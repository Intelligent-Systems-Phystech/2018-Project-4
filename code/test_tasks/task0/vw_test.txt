If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this, %0A then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably %0A in lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC %0A pickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley %0A Sportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who've %0A tried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain %0A plugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers %0A are pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who %0A have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead, %0A I'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make %0A the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look %0A really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head) %0A --  %0A ============================================================================= %0A Neal Howard   '91 XLH-1200      DoD #686      CompuTrac, Inc (Richardson, TX) %0A 	      doh #0000001200   %7C355o33%7C      neal %40 cmptrc.lonestar.org %0A 	      Std disclaimer %3A  My opinions are mine, not CompuTrac's. %0A          "Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps %0A           we shall learn the truth." -- August Kekule' (1890) %0A ============================================================================= %0A

As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases %0A and hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output %0A voltage as possible. (about 260v). %0A   The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages %0A (ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v %0A across them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v. %0A   Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v. %0A  If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will %0A increase the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem. %0A These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of %0A them, So %3A  %0A  %0A 1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel  %0A with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)? %0A   Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase %0A the RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more %0A stable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone... %0A as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new %0A capacitor will 'smooth' this out. %0A  %0A and %0A 2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to %0A be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out %0A the 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible ! %0A  %0A   I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH %0A of a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my  %0A dissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not %0A playing with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long %0A run... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!) %0A  %0A Email please....

The new cryptography scheme was  %0A announced today by the White House and the National Institute  %0A for Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the  %0A technical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman  %0A acknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super- %0A secret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the  %0A encryption technology around which the new initiative is built. %0A  %0A 	According to NIST, the technical specifications and the  %0A Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To  %0A open the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today  %0A filed a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests  %0A with key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security  %0A Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption  %0A plan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the  %0A Computer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to  %0A open the development of non-military computer security standards  %0A to public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of  %0A such standards. %0A  %0A 	CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in  %0A developing the so-called "digital signature standard" (DSS), a  %0A communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for  %0A government-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA  %0A lawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first  %0A time that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.   %0A NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying  %0A the classification of records concerning its creation of the  %0A DSS. %0A  %0A 	David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the  %0A administration's apparent commitment to the privacy of  %0A electronic communications, as reflected in today's official  %0A statement,  "a step in the right direction."  But he questioned  %0A the propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent  %0A secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from  %0A public scrutiny.  "At a time when we are moving towards the  %0A development of a new information infrastructure, it is vital  %0A that standards designed to protect personal privacy be  %0A established openly and with full public participation.  It is  %0A not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of  %0A secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to  %0A play a leading role in the development process."  %0A  %0A 	CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer  %0A industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of  %0A technology on society.   CPSR has 21 chapters in the U.S. and  %0A maintains offices in Palo Alto, California, Cambridge,  %0A Massachusetts and Washington, DC.

North-ame- %0A ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average %0A european player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better  %0A skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL %0A are mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league %0A game is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many  %0A breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in %0A NHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because %0A of clumsy defensemen. %0A  %0A I have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars %0A aren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeans %0A are in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in the %0A class of his own).  %0A  %0A Tommi %0A

This could be substantially %0A the same as the cripple chip, except that instead of key-registration, the %0A police could demand that you give up your secret key to them (with a court- %0A issued warrant).

It's actually a pretty good show and Don %0A isn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is were %0A Don got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure.  Don use to coach the %0A Boston Bruins.  I don't know exactly when that was.  Could someone fill %0A me in on this info? %0A   A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesday %0A morning.  Personally, I've had my fill of Donny!  He really pisses me off %0A sometimes.  During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC, Don gave %0A high praise to Doug Gilmour, saying he was a two-way player and not %0A just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player %0A in the game because of that.  That's fine and I agree that Gilmour %0A is a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman %0A about a month ago on a local radio talk show.  What gives? %0A   It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from %0A city to city. %0A   Don Cherry %3A   'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in> %0A               is the best two-way player in the league today.' %0A   %0A   There have been other times (can't remember exactly what he said) that he %0A basically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to. %0A   Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario %0A Lemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs %0A from the Civic Center (Yes, I think the Pens will make it out of the %0A Wales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about %0A Lemieux.  In my opinion, he is an ass.  And I won't change my opinion %0A if I'm in a different city. %0A   Sorry, if this didn't answer your question better but I just had to get %0A this off my chest. %0A   %0A Laurie Marshall %0A Wayne State University %0A Detroit, Michigan %0A Go Wings!!! %0A

The biggest %0A problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded. %0A  %0A In almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outlets %0A with the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things you %0A can plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers they %0A were a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memory %0A periodically. %0A  %0A With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be %0A less of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longer %0A recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their %0A equipment.

He then was sent down to %0A Kansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated %0A when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from %0A the watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks %0A officials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him. %0A  %0A #10	JOHAN GARPENLOV		Season %3A  3rd %0A Acquired %3A 	'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round %0A 		pick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver %0A Grade %3A 		A/A- %0A  %0A After an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest %0A of the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the %0A team, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob %0A Gaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in %0A the MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he %0A was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him %0A by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power- %0A play goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite %0A his small size (5' 11", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around %0A when necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work %0A on his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and %0A was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will %0A be a major key to the offense next year. %0A  %0A #15	DAVID BRUCE		Season %3A  5th %0A Acquired %3A 	'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft %0A Grade %3A 		I (?) %0A  %0A After a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and %0A was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered %0A virtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the %0A lineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to %0A speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by %0A the injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man %0A short in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive %0A leader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame, %0A because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his %0A future with the Sharks next season appears clouded. %0A  %0A #18	MARK PEDERSON		Season %3A 	3rd %0A Acquired %3A 	'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud %0A Grade %3A 		I (B) %0A  %0A It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson, %0A after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but %0A after riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the %0A Sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with %0A 41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by %0A injuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when %0A healthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size %0A (and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a %0A physical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability %0A on defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how %0A much, exactly, Pederson can do. %0A  %0A #20	JOHN CARTER		Season %3A  4th %0A Acquired %3A 	'91-92, free agent from Boston %0A Grade %3A 		I (B+/B) %0A  %0A Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard %0A work worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he %0A did look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55 %0A games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can %0A do, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about %0A 20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always %0A hussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive %0A zone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end, %0A but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress %0A offensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He %0A is very unlikely to be back next season. %0A  %0A #28	JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN	Season %3A  1st %0A Acquired %3A 	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft %0A Grade %3A 		I (B+/B) %0A  %0A I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the %0A 14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating %0A opportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL %0A duty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those %0A 14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training %0A camp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in %0A exhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the %0A Sharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a %0A solid contender for regular duty next season. %0A  %0A #41	MARK BEAUFAIT		Season %3A  1st %0A Acquired %3A 	2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft %0A Grade %3A 		I (?) %0A  %0A After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the %0A Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the %0A Sharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only %0A NHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy %0A to throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times, %0A although it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played %0A mostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and %0A Kansas City. %0A  %0A #42	JAROSLAV OTEVREL	Season %3A  1st %0A Acquired %3A 	8th round pick in 1991 entry draft %0A Grade %3A 		I (?) %0A  %0A Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was %0A up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally %0A very much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either, %0A although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those %0A 7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his %0A defense is acceptable, he should be ready. %0A  %0A #44	MICHEL PICARD		Season %3A  1st %0A Acquired %3A 	'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau %0A Grade %3A 		I (B-/C+) %0A  %0A The 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to %0A be close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the %0A Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for %0A his only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City. %0A He was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive %0A brilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although %0A he has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the %0A expansion draft. %0A  %0A #45	DODY WOOD		Season %3A  1st %0A Acquired %3A 	3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft %0A Grade %3A 		I (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all) %0A  %0A I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much.  %3A -)  Then, it is probably %0A no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although %0A 13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was %0A not particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing %0A many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games, %0A projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at %0A least another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if %0A nothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11", 181 lbs.) does not give much %0A possibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer. %0A  %0A =============================================================================== %0A GO CALGARY FLAMES!

I upgraded my motherboard last fall.

"I %0A think I have worked hard enough for that." %0A  %0A Stauber said he accepts Melrose's choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie %0A in their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays %0A 6-3 opening victory. %0A  %0A But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick %0A Knickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the %0A stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey. %0A  %0A Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was  %0A yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29. %0A  %0A Yet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup %0A again and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic %0A Saddledome popcorn. %0A  %0A "If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I %0A dropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?"  Stauber wondered.  "Not that I'd be %0A happy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the %0A playoffs." %0A  %0A Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not %0A convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure. %0A  %0A While insisting he is the Kings' "goalie of the future," Melrose said Stauber %0A flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were, %0A according to Melrose %3A  a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New %0A York Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to  %0A Vancouver on Thursday. %0A  %0A "Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could %0A have taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it," Melrose said.  "An %0A elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a %0A great goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup." %0A  %0A "I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've %0A got to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything %0A is on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect %0A more from him than he does." %0A  %0A Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the %0A team hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed %0A off the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end. %0A  %0A "I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose," said Stauber, %0A a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only  %0A to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries. %0A  %0A "What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated %0A disk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do %0A expect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here." %0A  %0A "Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry  %0A doesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm %0A a perfectionist." %0A  %0A Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. "But  %0A even though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's  %0A a bit of a jump," he said.  "You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game  %0A you're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67  %0A and then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain  %0A to him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I  %0A do know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there." %0A  %0A Melrose's "goalie of the future" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. "Before %0A you know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future," he said. %0A  %0A ------ %0A  %0A *Game 1 of the Kings  %40  Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC  %0A Channel 7 here in LA.

There %0A are some women rider friendly places in the San Francisco/San Jose %0A area, but I don't recommend buying clothing mail order.  Too hard %0A to tell if it'll fit.  Bates custom makes leathers.  You might want %0A to call them (they're in L.A.) and get a cost estimate for the type %0A of jacket your wife is interested in.  Large manufacturers like %0A BMW and H.G. sell women's lines of clothing of decent quality, but %0A fit is iffy. %0A  %0A A while ago, Noemi and Lisa Sieverts were talking about starting %0A a business doing just this sort of thing.

I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from  %0A Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are rated %0A at 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to %0A the relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relay %0A pins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and used %0A a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA. %0A 	I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front %0A fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube %0A frame used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing to %0A do this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two %0A vertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairing %0A follows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing. %0A The compressor is about 2" in diameter and about 5" long. %0A 	The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is small %0A so there should be plenty of good places for it. %0A 	I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to %0A mount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side %0A just in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of the %0A horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where %0A the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enough %0A room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nice %0A cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into. %0A 	The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks out %0A about an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you look %0A closely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight %0A ahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you). %0A 	If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can try %0A to explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint them %0A first. %0A 	How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They sound %0A more like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock. %0A I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse has %0A not blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short). %0A 	I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even though %0A they know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keeping %0A the pedestrians on the sidewalk. %0A The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to %0A those stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives) %0A and are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

Using this line of reasoning, the %0A government shouldn't be able to restrict what data people encrypt and %0A what encryption algorithms they use because this would be restricting %0A one's freedom of speech.  In other words, encrypted data---text, %0A graphics, or other information---is just another form of free speech. %0A For this reason the government shouldn't be able to regulate the use %0A of encryption algorithms and encrypted data.  The only time the %0A government should be able to 'force' someone to reveal his or her %0A encryption keys for some encrypted data is when the encrypted data %0A in question may be something that isn't protected by the first %0A amendment such as kiddy porn.

The %0A only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if %0A he stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been %0A quoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the %0A Ducks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper, %0A and he's tweaking it a bit second time around).

I stuck some  "gun-gum" %0A    into the smaller holes and bunged the pipes back onto the bike. %0A  %0A    So, last night  I'm on the  way home  when lo' an'  bloody behold,  the %0A    sodding thing starts  blowing again.   I check  it out and  the gas  is %0A    escaping from around  the clamp holding  the number two  pipe into  the %0A    port.  As far as I can see (it being somewhat "hole of Calcutta" at the %0A    time!), the nuts are still there  (stop that bloody sniggering, you  at %0A    the back!), but the pipe is a bit loose. %0A  %0A    This morning  I go  out to  the bike  and pull  out the  socket-set  to %0A    tighten up me' nuts (somebody give that  spotty kid at the back a  good %0A    slap  round  the  back  of  the  head!),  and  lo'  an'  bloody  behold %0A    a-bloody-gen, I find that the outer skin of the pipe has separated from %0A    the inner sleeve right at the clamp-mating bevel.  So, I stuff in a bit %0A    of baked-beanz can and a bit more of Mr Holts' very best "gun-gum"  and %0A    come to work (late again!) so that I  can ask of the oracle...  Will  a %0A    brazed joint hold that close to the exhaust port?

For those who've not %0A had the pleasure %3A  %0A  %0A It is a MIDI controlled (no keyboard of it's own) rackmountable digital voice %0A processor.  What can it do with your voice?  It can pitch-shift it (change the %0A notes you sing).  It can add harmonies to your singing (up to 5 parts at one %0A time).  It can change your voice into a synthesizer's voice but leave what %0A you say alone and intelligible.  This works well for a "computerized" sounding %0A singer, or robot voice.  For those of you who just thought about that, yes - %0A you can do the voices from Robo-Cop, and the old ELO lead-ins with it, and yes - %0A I'm a little red-faced to say that I tried those specifically.  For an input, %0A it takes both %3A  XLR (3-prong mic) and 1/4" cables.  For output, you can have %0A a combination of the original-input-only, and your choice of mix between the %0A original signal and the effect (can be effect only if desired).  It has preset %0A setups, which you can edit and save for your own preferences.  It has a couple %0A of light scratches, but does not look bad, and works flawlessly.  Even when we %0A don't use it in my music, it's been good for after-hours fun in the studio. %0A The manual is included.  I never got around to getting rack-ears for it, but %0A it has only gotten studio use from me - no roading, so it's not beaten. %0A --  %0A       oooooooo       o     o                      Steve Hitch %0A      oo      o     oo    oo       My opinions are my own.

I know this %0A  %3A  would not be many miles for a car but I am unfamiliar with the life %0A  %3A  span of bikes. 2) Is this a decent price? I am also unfamilar with %0A  %3A  prices for used bikes. Is there a blue book for bikes like there is %0A  %3A  for cars?. %0A  %0A  %3A  Thanks for any advice you can give. %0A  %0A  %3A                              --Mark %0A  %0A  %0A -- %0A  _______________________ K _ E _ N ____________________________ %0A %7C                                                              %7C %0A %7C Ken Snyder              ms/loc %3A  330 / UN2                    %7C %0A %7C Hewlett-Packard Co.

It was a bit shorter %0A than I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big %0A presentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more %0A bare-bones. %0A  %0A In any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would %0A hear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike, %0A maybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it %0A in. %0A  %0A After the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written %0A questions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only %0A had monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed. %0A  %0A So, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question %0A being read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took. %0A Presumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all %0A the difference. %0A  %0A So, on to the substance. The question was  %0A  %0A Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such %0A as a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete %0A with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed %0A by Mcdonnell Douglass? %0A  %0A Well, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me, %0A then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last %0A part first. %0A  %0A This is to the best of my recollection what he said. %0A  %0A As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better %0A answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers  %0A about that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High %0A speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at %0A this point. %0A  %0A So, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial %0A arena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that  %0A they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them %0A to persue work on their own. %0A  %0A Now, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually, %0A this is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this %0A guy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space %0A lifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where %0A the TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman %0A of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are %0A trying to do something with it.   %0A  %0A Anybody know anything further? %0A Is this really news? %0A Does this threaten further work on DC-? ? %0A  %0A                     John. %0A

Well, who cares. %0A  %0A First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the %0A Clipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us %3A  %0A  %0A The chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs %0A general encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB %0A ECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm %0A consists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data %0A seems to be 64 Bit? Yes. %0A So if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when  %0A Clipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key.  %0A (Or is it one key per direction ?) %0A They can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however. %0A Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip %0A which is now ready to work. %0A The clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits. %0A These 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number %0A with 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip) %0A At beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??) %0A before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper %0A chip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number, %0A and the session key. This might look like %0A X{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number} %0A where X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key. %0A This family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???) %0A After that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet %0A being encrypted and decrypted by Clipper. %0A  %0A Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160 %0A Bit's. %0A  %0A Now, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not %0A being an American Citicien(tm) [  %3A -) ] , there are some weak points in this %0A scheme, which might be exploited by several parties. %0A  %0A As far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the  %0A obvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing %0A the serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't %0A imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources %0A for the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money. %0A  %0A Then, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security %0A could (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits %0A each, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply %0A assume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or %0A law enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows %0A and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on %0A and so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding %0A chip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [  %3A -)) ]. %0A How about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that %0A the police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode %0A this session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this %0A after the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution, %0A but I guess politics will not work that way. %0A  %0A Apparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes %0A of intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter- %0A cept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes %0A the right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who %0A is allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi- %0A cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company %0A to the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far %0A as I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching- %0A company, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key %0A will not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable %0A by anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis! %0A  %0A What do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the %0A first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session %0A key would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so %0A difficult to do *that*  %3A ^) %0A  %0A And now a last point, for the other side. After all I have read and heard about %0A Clipper (not the programming language for dBase, is it ? [ %3A -)]) it seems %0A to have many advantages, which shold not be overseen! %0A  %0A  %0A Now an afterthought to your rights.

NYI has been bagging it of late. %0A NYI and NJD have a showdown Friday night for the honour %0A of Pittsburg anyway.  Pigsburg in 4. %0A  %0A WASH vs NJD %3A   WASH in 6.  %0A I think that NJD have a solid team and will compete with %0A WASH.  I agree though with WASH in 6. %0A  %0A BOS  vs BUF %3A   BOS  in 5.  %0A The B's have been playing awesome hockey in the last %0A two weeks.  The only question is how long will it last? %0A Fuhr is a dud.  BOS in 4. %0A  %0A QUE  vs MON %3A   MON  in 7. %0A It seems to me that MON is much like the VAN - no chemistry. %0A The Habs seem to be not in stride. QUE in 5.   %0A  %0A CHI  vs STL %3A   CHI in 4.  %0A STL should not be in the playoffs. CHI in 4. %0A  %0A DET  vs TOR %3A   DET in 6. %0A I am a diehard Leaf fan but ... It seems that the Leafs %0A offense is shutting down in the last week.  Can they %0A turn it around against Detroit.  As I recall, the last %0A couple of time these two teams met, the Leafs were pummelled. %0A I don't know if Bobbie is allowed in Canada yet.  If he is, %0A DET in 5.  If not, DET in 6. %0A  %0A VAN  vs WIN %3A   WIN in 6. %0A  %0A Upset in the making here.  Another team with bad chemistry. %0A There is something gone foul among Linden, Momesso and Bure. %0A WIN in 6. %0A  %0A CAL  vs  LA %3A   CAL in 5. %0A Anybody that says that LA could possibly beet CAL does %0A not watch the Smythe a whole lot.  LA is a bunch of Geritols. %0A CAL in 4. %0A  %0A  %0A 2nd round %3A   %0A ---------- %0A  %0A PITT vs WASH %3A  PITT in 4.  %0A It seems to me that Pigsburg has some egos on their team.  Their %0A saving grace though is Bowman.  He can put anybody in their place. %0A However, if PIGS have a quick first round, they may be a little %0A too high.  WASH could be there for a surprise.  Having said that, %0A I will say PITT in 6. %0A  %0A BOS  vs MON %3A   BOS  in 6. %0A MON will not be there.  BOS is surprising me of late. Cam is great. %0A The couple of wins against QUE last week have sold me with the %0A B's.  B's in 6. %0A  %0A  %0A CHI  vs DET %3A   CHI  in 7. %0A Yikes.  This will not be pretty.  But DET is running like a machine %0A of late.  They've had a non-busy end of the season in which they played %0A like killers.  DET in 6. %0A  %0A WIN  vs CAL %3A   CAL  in 5. %0A CAL has a solid team, a little weak in the nets.  CAL will out %0A muscle WIN.  CAL in 5. %0A  %0A 3rd round %3A   %0A ---------- %0A  %0A PITT vs BOS %3A   PITT in 5.  %0A  %0A I hate PITT.  My logic eludes me.  The dark side will take over %0A and give BOS the extra push it needs to dump PITT.  There may %0A be something to this - if you think of the rivalry.  BOS in 7. %0A CHI  vs CAL %3A   CHI  in 5.  %0A  %0A Finals %3A  %0A ------ %0A  %0A PITT vs CHI %3A  PITT in 5.  %0A  %0A NO, no, no.  We have BOS vs DET.  I don't know what to say %0A here.  Both teams will be flying and overdue.  I will go %0A with goaltending and muscle and say DET in 7. %0A  %0A  %0A -jake. %0A  %0A  %0A  %0A  %0A

Thus keeping the Hawks %0A in the New Brunswick city. %0A  %0A The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if %0A the season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold %0A 1400 for this year. %0A  %0A SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL %0A The Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of %0A Saint John, NB.

That means if the Isles %0A beat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs. %0A  %0A 	However, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in %0A general that I need to get off my chest  %3A ).  First of all, with the Islanders  %0A back-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that  %0A the Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period, %0A come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable %0A how many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty  %0A wide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played  %0A a golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL  %0A debut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this  %0A guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a  %0A Mahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot  %0A correctly.  Has anyone else noticed this? %0A  %0A 	Also, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick %0A Vukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey %0A talent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the %0A puck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties.  %0A Richard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's a %0A defenseman.

In other words, a violation of "hockey ethics" %0A might cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are %0A losing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees %0A need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already.  %0A I'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the %0A referee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy, %0A not physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost.  %0A If you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to %0A pull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place. %0A  %0A Just My Honest Opinion, %0A  %0A Gary at Hofstra %0A ACCGSG %40 VAXB.HOFSTRA.EDU %0A ACCGSG %40 HOFSTRA.BITNET %0A

McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the %0A crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real- %0A istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they %0A still go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the %0A game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the %0A NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is  %0A bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are %0A trying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect  %0A examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being %0A benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals %0A that would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to %0A attract, that these players are indeed superstars. %0A  %0A >>They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is  %0A >>true.

These lines were taken as  %0A  strong evidence for neutron stars being the objects responsible for  %0A  GRBs since the magnetic field indicated was 1.0E12, fairly typical  %0A  for a neutron star.

However, if they are in the halo, in order  %0A  that they appear isotropic, the "core radius" of the halo (i.e. the  %0A  innermost region of the halo) has to be greater than about 50 kpc. %0A  The halo itself would stretch much further than this.  Since the  %0A  Andromeda Galaxy is only 700 kpc away, we should be seeing bursts %0A  from that galaxy's halo, which we aren't. %0A  %0A js> If the bursts are something like the cosmic black body radiation from %0A js> way back then where are the red shifts - I mean cosmological red shifts? %0A  %0A  Remember to get a redshift, one needs some type of emission or  %0A  absorption line so one can compare the observed line frequency  %0A  to the rest line frequency.

The EGS optical tracking experiment process and an %0A outline of the Radio Research Laboratory (RRL) optical ground       <---- %0A station are discussed. A star tracking technique for optical %0A equipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit %0A prediction improvement are also described. The accuracy of EGS %0A tracking data obtained by RRL at the request of NASDA is also %0A discussed. In addition, it is briefly demonstrated that the %0A position of the Japanese amateur satellite (JAS-1) which was %0A launched with the EGS, was accurately determined by means of a      <---- %0A satellite tracking video. It is clear from this experiment that     <---- %0A optical observation data (i.e., satellite direction data) are very  <---- %0A useful for satellite orbit determination during initial launch      <---- %0A stages.

An automated data  %0A processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of  %0A orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail  %0A echoes or lightning atmospherics. Although the results are preliminary,  %0A they showed good agreement with those from NORAD tracking radar      <---- %0A observations using a much higher frequency. It is found that the     <---- %0A collision frequency of a Space Station of 1 km x 1 km size at an  %0A altitude of 500 km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as  %0A once per two years.  %0A  %0A  %0A Monitoring of the MU radar antenna pattern by Satellite Ohzora (EXOS-C) %0A SATO, T.; INOOKA, Y.; FUKAO, S.

Unlike the conventional large  %0A VHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed  %0A to individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier  %0A feeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast  %0A beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the  %0A antenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal  %0A division/combination are performed at a low signal level using  %0A electronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna  %0A beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the  %0A zenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element  %0A is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful  %0A calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna  %0A element was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for  %0A this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to  %0A make a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern  %0A monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific  %0A satellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna  %0A Monitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400  %0A watts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement  %0A and results are discussed. %0A  %0A  %0A Equatorial radar system %0A FUKAO, SHOICHIRO;  TSUDA, TOSHITAKA; SATO, TORU; KATO, SUSUMU %0A (Kyoto University, Uji, Japan) %0A (COSPAR, IAGA, SCOSTEP, et al., Plenary Meeting, 27th, %0A Workshops and Symposium on the Earth's Middle Atmosphere, %0A Espoo, Finland, July 18-29, 1988) Advances in Space Research %0A (ISSN 0273-1177), vol. 10, no. 10, 1990, p. 151-154. %0A      A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent  %0A scatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000  %0A km altitude is now being designed in Japan. The radar will be built in  %0A Pontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia (0.03 deg N, 109.29 deg E). The  %0A system is a 47-MHz monostatic Doppler radar with an active phased array  %0A configuration similar to that of the MU radar in Japan, which has been  %0A in successful operation since 1983. It will have a PA product of about  %0A 3 x 10 to the 9th W sq m (P = average transmitter power, A = effective  %0A antenna aperture) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 times that of  %0A the MU radar. This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam  %0A steering within 20 deg from the zenith.

The passenger %0A seats are not designed for long rides.  The passenger positions aren't %0A even usually designed for short rides.  I ended up torturing my knees and my %0A back by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes.  One of the %0A reasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had %0A a BMW.  %3A ) %0A  %0A I'd suggest a shorter extended ride at first -- a short turn in the mountains %0A or some such.  Then see how much pain she's in, and proceed from there. %0A  %0A The best advice I'd give a beginning passenger %3A  %0A  %0A - Don't get on the bike until the rider says its OK, and work out some sort %0A   signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off.  After I get on  %0A   the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that I'm ready, and at the stop %0A   he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off. %0A  %0A - Keep your feet on the pegs at all times.  Don't wiggle (unless your rider %0A   asks you to  %3A ) %0A  %0A - The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive.  Echo the movements %0A   and lean of your rider.  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable, %0A   but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn. %0A  %0A - Get used to your rider's shifting style (Riders %3A   use a reasonably %0A   consistent shifting style).  Avoid "helmet bonk."  Helmet bonk is  %0A   when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change %0A   in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his/hers.  It %0A   gets old real fast. %0A  %0A - When pulling to a stop, put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep %0A   your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank.  Putting your hands %0A   on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you're in pain, %0A   but I'm told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there. %0A  %0A - Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders, but be  %0A   sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're %0A   still there.  %3A )  The guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider. %0A  %0A - Don't be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you're in pain or %0A   losing feeling in your feet.  Passenger seats are not generally designed  %0A   for comfort.  Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand. %0A  %0A  %0A --  %0A ********************************************************* %0A Laura Lemay                              lemay %40 netcom.com %0A writer of trifles in shadows and blood %0A ********************************************************* %0A  %0A

Since the  %0A  Andromeda Galaxy is only 700 kpc away, we should be seeing bursts %0A  from that galaxy's halo, which we aren't. %0A  %0A js> If the bursts are something like the cosmic black body radiation from %0A js> way back then where are the red shifts - I mean cosmological red shifts? %0A  %0A  Remember to get a redshift, one needs some type of emission or  %0A  absorption line so one can compare the observed line frequency  %0A  to the rest line frequency.  Since no lines are seen in GRB spectra,  %0A  that comparison cannot be made. %0A  %0A -- %0A                          %7C e-mail %3A  lazio %40 astrosun.tn.cornell.edu %0A    T.

I'll try to post the standings after "each game" %0A (i.e. every two days). %0A  %0A I managed to recover the email lost up to Saturday night, so all I'm missing %0A is mail that arrived between early Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon. %0A Many people re-sent their teams, so you may have received two replies back %0A from me.  If your team name is not on this list, please resend your team %0A to me and I'll see what I can do.  Any kind of "proof" you sent it on the %0A weekend will help your case.   %3A -)  Seriously, this is only a fun pool and %0A I trust each person to be honest. %0A  %0A Again, sorry for any inconvenience, and I hope the pool is still fun for you. %0A  %0A 	- Andrew %0A  %0A  %0A USENET Hockey Playoff Draft Standings %0A  %0A Posn	Team				Pts	Rem	Last Posn %0A  %0A 1.

Some stuff is up for offers, some %0A isn't.  Please read carefully. %0A  %0A  %0A In the MAKE OFFER department %3A  %0A  %0A 	WordPerfect 5.0, upgrade copy.  Includes all disks and all upgrade %0A 	manuals.  Best offer. %0A  %0A 	Balance of Power, 1992 edition, for the Amiga.  With manual and reg. %0A 	card.  Best offer. %0A  %0A  %0A In the FOR SALE department %3A  %0A  %0A 	Technics model 715 auto-reverse open-reel STEREO tape deck.  Because %0A 	it's auto-reverse, this deck records onto tape just like a cassette %0A 	deck does, so it's not very good for splice-type editing.  However, %0A 	I have used it effectively in "tape studio" applications for mastering, %0A 	and it works great.  3.75 and 7.5 ips speeds, supports up to 7" reels. %0A 	Dual lighted VU meters with record indicators.  Full auto-reverse %0A 	capable (and the mechanism works, too!).  Adjustable sound on sound, %0A 	and socket for remote control (I don't know where you'd find one, but %0A 	they used to make 'em), plus a 110VAC unswitched outlet.  This unit %0A 	is in excellent condition and I have had it rebuilt once since I got %0A 	it--works perfectly. %0A  %0A 	Price %3A   $225.00 or best offer, or possible trade (see below). %0A  %0A  %0A 	Panasonic KX-P1624 printer.  24-pin with 360x360dpi resolution in both %0A 	text and graphics modes.  Warranty cards, manuals, all the usual stuff %0A 	you expect when buying like-new merchandise.  I'm selling it because I %0A 	now have a better printer.  This is the wide carriage version of the %0A 	KX-P1124, by the way.  Test prints are available upon request. %0A  %0A 	Price %3A   $250.00 o.b.o. or trade. %0A  %0A  %0A 	Excalibur custom pool cue.  19 oz., 13 mm, brass joint, Irish linen %0A 	wrap, could use a new tip but will hold up for a while.  I've got too %0A 	many cues as it is, and don't need this one.  Hits nicely, is very %0A 	straight and in excellent condition. %0A  %0A 	Price %3A   $125.00 o.b.o. or trade.  Imperial hard case (1 butt/1 shaft) %0A 	available for an additional $40.00. %0A  %0A  %0A TRADES %3A   I need the following things, and I have no cash of my own right now, %0A so if you want to trade, it needs to be straight-across.   The list %3A  %0A  %0A 	Amiga ROM upgrade to at LEAST 2.04, preferably 2.1+, with appropriate %0A 	DOS and Workbench. %0A  %0A 	1 meg Agnus chip for the Amiga. %0A  %0A 	Amiga hard drive and controller (preferably SCSI). %0A  %0A 	IBM-compatible hard drive (and controller if not MFM).  This one's  %0A 	touchy, as I have a full-height and don't have room for more unless %0A 	I swap out--needs to be above 100M, and I will consider trading a %0A 	good ST-4096 in the deal. %0A  %0A 	Intel 9600EX or 14.4EX or similar EXTERNAL high-speed modem. %0A  %0A  %0A This is not a complete list, but it's close.  If you've got something way off %0A the track of this list, it's probably not going to interest me at this point. %0A Email responses, please. %0A  %0A

If the (naive) %0A market is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong  %0A encryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcast %0A standard, and then sold TVs below cost.

Even though the industry's technology is better, %0A the programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard. %0A Who could compete? %0A  %0A   The other flaw, of course, is that making something voluntary today ensures %0A that it will be voluntary in the future. I went to renew my CA drivers license %0A last week and was required not only to give my SSN, but to PRODUCE AN SSN %0A CARD to veryify the number!

The SQ-80 is a powerful performance %0A oriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it because %0A it has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog %0A synth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more "digital". %0A Below are a list of features extracted from the owner's manual %3A  %0A   o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of %0A     playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo %0A     panning for each voice %0A   o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different %0A     attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds %0A   o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source %0A   o Dynamic voice allocation %3A   each sequencer track/MIDI channel has %0A     access to all eight voices %0A   o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight %0A     MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity %0A     sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch. %0A   o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of  %0A     modulation sources and routings. %0A   o A 3.5" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks %0A     allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to %0A     1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot %0A     for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts. %0A   o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device %0A   o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly "page-driven" %0A     programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface %0A   o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening %0A   o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1 %0A     so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on %0A     the SQ-80. %0A  %0A This SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while %0A now.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily %0A used sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed %0A with this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer %0A (WinCake) in its multitimbral mode. %0A  %0A >From a synthesis point of view, this machine is a hybrid.  It uses looped %0A short samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves %0A are processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80 %0A is capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter. %0A Simply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most %0A good analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it %0A works very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this %0A thing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds. %0A This SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have %0A an 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain %0A to use so I have avoided it. %0A  %0A REASON FOR SALE %3A  %0A I am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual %0A here in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  I %0A recommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a %0A powerful but economical master keyboard. %0A  %0A PRICING AND TERMS %3A  %0A I paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  I am willing to accept %0A $650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).  I will include a bunch of  %0A patches on SQ-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the  %0A original Ensoniq SQ-80 owner's manual. %0A  %0A Price %3A     Asking $650.00 (everything) %0A Shipping %3A  split shipping (UPS Surface COD) anywhere in the lower 48 states %0A ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- %0A Craig Vanderborgh                                         Verbex Voice Systems %0A e-mail %3A   craigv %40 rad.verbex.com                            119 Russell Street %0A phone %3A  (508) 486-8886                                     Littleton, MA 01460 %0A ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- %0A  %0A  %0A

Ed Byrnes %0A  %0A  %0A Aaahh... a problem very near and dear to my heart. In our case, other %0A monitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to be %0A specific. Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this %0A problem. This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etc %0A several 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but the %0A juice running to them must pass nearby your monitor. Fusebox on other side %0A of wall maybe? %0A We started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable input %0A lines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interference %0A effect on the computer monitor next to it.  %0A Now on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (very %0A common, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type %0A O'scopes). %0A I talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mount %0A around deflection coil of interfering monitor.  %0A BE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH %0A VOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'T %0A BLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO %0A MOUNT CAN. %0A Now, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also %0A good at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on %0A monitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those other %0A sources. %0A  %0A Jeff Babb %0A babb %40 sciences.sdsu.edu   babb %40 ucssun1.sdsu.edu %0A Programmer, SDSU - LARC %0A

Yes, they sign some %0A (damned few -- which is why everyone is always having to go to %0A Washington to see about next week's funding) multi-year contracts; %0A they also aren't willing to include sufficient cancellation penalties %0A when they *do* decide to cut the multi-year contract and not pay on it %0A (which can happen arbitrarily at any time, no matter what previous %0A plans were) to make the risk acceptable of something like putting up a %0A private space station with the government as the expected prime %0A occupant. %0A  %0A I'd like a source for that statement about "the reason they aren't %0A cutting defense spending as much as they would like"; I just don't buy %0A it.

To get an image on the screen, you had to wait %0A until the raster line your picture started at, load bitmaps for this line %0A into the 'sprite' registers, tell them what x positions to take, how many %0A duplicates you wanted, etc, then do it all again for the next line. This %0A took all of the processor's time during the visible portion of the %0A display. %0A  %0A >There was also a standard 6532 RAM, I/O, Timer (RIOT), plus a voltage %0A >regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer.  That's all. %0A  %0A The RAM was mapped into the top 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in page %0A 1. The 6502 has a zero-page addressing mode on most instructions that is %0A both shorter and faster than the normal ones, so it is important on a %0A machine like this to have the scratchpad RAM in page 0. Unfortunately, it %0A also wants its stack to be in page 1 (the stack pointer is 8 bits, and the %0A high byte of the address is hardwired to 1). %0A  %0A The IOT section was mapped into page 2 somewhere. 2 8 bit I/O registers %0A (can't remember if each bit could be independantly set to I or O like the %0A 6522 and 6526), and 1(?) 8(?) bit timer with a programmable prescaler (I %0A think this was some power of 2). There were no interrupts in the system, so %0A many games would set up the timer at some known time, go away and do %0A something else for a while, then sit and wait for the timer to run down. %0A  %0A There was no logic in the box to do address decoding - the RIOT had at %0A least 2 chip select pins (probably one active high, one active low), and I %0A imagine the TIA was much the same. Various address lines were fed directly %0A to chip selects. The 6507 likes to have ROM right at the top of memory, so %0A the 2600 had to use ROMs with active high chip selects - not exactly %0A normal, so some cartriges had a 7404 in them to convert this to the more %0A usual active low chip select. %0A  %0A John West %0A

Three lawyers and about a hundred citizens found an ancient law %0A in Manchester's books which clearly from context was designed to %0A prohibit travelling carnivals by enumerating the features of a carnival %0A which they felt at the time made the prohibition obvious. Among these %0A things was "shooting galleries," which is what the lawyers for the %0A opposition to LaserGames wanted to harp upon. The judge took the two %0A words from this law, completely out of context, and ruled that %0A LaserGames could not operate in Manchester. %0A  %0A   Keep in mind that most travelling carnivals use projectile weapons in %0A their shooting galleries, and not light beams.

This is IMHO the *only* way of effectively  %0A >protecting software. %0A  %0A There are several types of copy protection, and the point is to make sure the %0A user is using a legitimate copy.  The simplest and virtually fool-proof way is %0A for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on %0A (some sort of checksum, serial number, whatever) so a copy put on a different %0A machine (NOT installed from original disks) will not work.   %0A  %0A The program is definitely backupable, if restored to the same machine (depends %0A on the programmer...  don't use a disk drive characteristic!)  If the user  %0A did an upgrade to the machine, he/she should reinstall all programs any way. %0A No document look-up, no disk wear-and-tear! %0A  %0A I did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's  %0A conscience should do that. %0A  %0A I know, I'll get flamed for this...  But with the increasing number of "casual" %0A users who either unknowingly or don't care about the software copyrights %0A (It's the truth.  I have "friends" who ask me for copies of my latest games %0A all the time, and when I refused, they went after somebody else.), casual %0A pirating is becoming more of a problem.  Some sort of copy protection will %0A discourage the casual copying.  I've seen what some of my "friends" dug up %0A somewhere...  Latest and the greatest games, all cracked, WITHIN days of actual %0A release!  You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disable %0A the quiz?  TWO!  Yes, TWO!  (And don't ask me which ones they are.)  Determined %0A pirates are unstoppable, given enough time, but their results do not spread  %0A that far, since pirate boards are not that well-known, and easily tracked once %0A found by authorities.  It is the "casual" pirates that the copy protection is %0A determined to discourage. %0A  %0A What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus %0A a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup %0A "REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address, city, state zip" and disables the above. %0A Two benefits %3A  1) encourages registration, 2) cuts down on pirating and %0A makes it more traceable, because if the patch's registration message is %0A encrypted, it will be quite hard to change, and therefore provides a %0A stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands, and thus %0A violated their license agreement. %0A  %0A This way, the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal  %0A discomfort (who does major upgrades to their computer frequently?) as only %0A problem they have is they won't be able to restore to another computer. %0A  %0A The registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore %0A gains full rights, and can restore to different machines.  On the other hand, %0A the software company now have a record of where THIS particular copy is  %0A supposed to be.  If this user's copy was found to be somewhere it was not  %0A supposed to be, we know who has broken their license agreement.  Of course, %0A a hacker can break that eventually, but that's not the point, is it? %0A  %0A --Kasey Chang %0A

One %0A guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well, %0A I saw one think that someone said about "Show me a team that used Split- %0A fires...."  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories %0A about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages. %0A  %0A Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and %0A increased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires %0A increased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing %0A on horsepower numbers. %0A  %0A Now how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that %0A depends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine? %0A In the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque, %0A but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low. %0A So for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power. %0A  %0A But what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins, %0A but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for %0A the hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However, %0A twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this %0A translate?  Increased torque should "theoretically" help twins make %0A more power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods %0A or anything made, just stick 'em in. %0A  %0A Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with %0A somebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than %0A 4's.         %0A  %0A As far as racing teams....  Ducati team "Fast by Ferraci" used %0A splitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James %0A running for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then. %0A Also, somebody check to see if they had them in 88..... %0A  %0A Peace. %0A  %0A Warren %0A wcd82671 %40 uxa.cso.uiuc.edu %0A "Have Suzuki, will travel..." %0A  %0A At a local "fix-er-up-er" shop, the bike repairest looked at a %0A dumped ZX-7.

The noise you hear is due to the momentary %0A opening and closing of the path. %0A  %0A The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high %0A impedance audio circuits a resistive "T" is constructed close to characteristic %0A impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers %0A the audio. %0A  %0A In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are %0A shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic %0A impedance. %0A  %0A Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used %0A to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time. %0A  %0A Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to "Make before %0A break and Vica Versa" but I haven't seen any of these for years. %0A  %0A Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc. %0A  %0A A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive "optical isolator".. It consists %0A of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is %0A off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers %0A passing the audio.  Once again this device in a "T" switches the audio.  Varying %0A the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and %0A you have a mixer! %0A  %0A Lots of luck! %0A --  %0A 73, Tom %0A ================================================================================ %0A Tom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when %0A (forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing. %0A The first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max %0A Friz's famous design, but with an overhead "point cam" (see below for %0A more on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground %0A clearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so %0A that the ground clearance was substantially increased %3A  %0A  %0A  %0A       == %40 ==   <-Springer motor (front) %0A                  Viking motor (front) ->   \= %40 =/ %0A  %0A This is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved %0A around a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn %0A in the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting %0A rods to accomodate the stroke. %0A  %0A The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still %0A unique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and %0A and extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was %0A required to drive both overhead valves. %0A  %0A Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a %0A pressurized stream of oil to power the "waterwheel" which kept the lobe %0A spinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal %0A engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to %0A normal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random, %0A resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a %0A little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the %0A beast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to %0A pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however, %0A uses an electric oil pump. Wimps). %0A  %0A Despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively %0A firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily %0A lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even %0A higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This %0A was feasible because it was a racing engine. %0A  %0A With just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers %0A because of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an %0A almost perfect point %3A  %0A  %0A                     /\ %0A                    /()\   <-lobe %0A                   / XX \  <-complex linkage (not shown due to %0A  valvestems ->   / \  / \    complexity) %0A                 %7C  %7C   %7C %7C %0A                 %7C  %7C===%7C %7C %0A                     =0=  <---piston %0A                      %7C %0A                              Note that the tip was not truly vertical %0A                              (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the %0A                              ground, and this drawing doesn't show the %0A                              curvature because there was none in the %0A                              head itself.

Your 2F2 cap %0A will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in %0A applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their %0A performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap. %0A The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances, %0A so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering %0A the cold). %0A  %0A You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain, %0A that "rolls over" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every %0A 1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would %0A need a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the %0A firing times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz %0A oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator %0A remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway. %0A  %0A I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the %0A solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit. %0A  %0A Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't %0A guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable %0A conditions. %0A  %0A JohnH %0A  %0A ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- %0A  %0A       %7C  _  %7C_   _   %7C_%7C  _   _%7C  _%7C              Electronics Department %0A     %7C_%7C (_) %7C %7C %7C %7C  %7C %7C (_%7C (_%7C (_%7C \/           School of MPCE %0A     ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University %0A                                                   Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109 %0A  %0A     Email %3A  johnh %40 mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph %3A  +61 2 805 8959, Fax %3A  +61 2 805 8983 %0A  %0A ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- %0A

That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor %0A here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the %0A current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing %0A and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open, %0A this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the %0A strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.   %0A Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get %0A one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these %0A draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W. %0A  %0A What you'll see when it's working %3A   powerup, string 1 will light  %0A at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current  %0A from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing  %0A both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a  %0A low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow  %0A at reduced brightness.  %0A  %0A Be sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires  %0A in a safe manner! %0A

There %0A was little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of %0A state universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII. %0A The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was %0A mainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that %0A many research universities, but they all provided their researchers with %0A low teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for %0A travel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a %0A university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well %0A as salary. %0A  %0A During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure %0A scientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they  %0A were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This is %0A probably because of the "research mind" approach, which is not to try %0A to find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution %0A emerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to %0A discussion about their problems, the job got done. %0A  %0A The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the %0A future, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was %0A unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the %0A future supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as  %0A NSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly %0A keep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations, %0A making it more difficult for them to act to support research. %0A  %0A The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which %0A the government supports research the university will not provide funding, %0A and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose, %0A as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of %0A a graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask %0A for one?  The answer I will get is, "Get the money from NSF."  Now the %0A money at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it %0A comes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from %0A getting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects %0A get supported, and how much.   %0A  %0A Also, the government decided that the "wealth" should be spread.  So instead %0A of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research %0A institutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into %0A being.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating %0A reseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal %0A has to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals %0A already done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am %0A proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find  %0A impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow %0A I may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea %0A which solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to %0A something I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast,  %0A and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it %0A is not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring  %0A more than minimal attention of a good researcher.   %0A  %0A I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would %0A have happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government %0A is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders. %0A --  %0A Herman Rubin, Dept. of Statistics, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette IN47907-1399 %0A Phone %3A  (317)494-6054 %0A hrubin %40 snap.stat.purdue.edu (Internet, bitnet)   %0A {purdue,pur-ee}!snap.stat!hrubin(UUCP) %0A

Your best bet is the vertical %0A output transistor(s) or, if there is one, the voltage regulator.  The most %0A common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn %0A somewhere. %0A Also look for shutdown circuits (which your TV may or may not have), %0A if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator %0A then it shouldn't be too hard to find the problem from there. %0A  %0A

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but %0A off ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the %0A leafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of %0A the seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played "home" games in places %0A like Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff "home" %0A games will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One %0A demostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus and %0A rocked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium. %0A Despite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs %0A will return to St John's once the strike ends. %0A =================================================== %0A SENATORS SOLD %0A The New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to %0A the Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian %0A NHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear %0A they intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic %0A Provinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL %0A head office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting %0A in May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it  %0A clear the league was more interested in the stability of the  %0A AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining %0A the 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven.  %0A  %0A The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown %0A New Brunswick and are expected to move there. %0A ================================================== %0A DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON %0A After announcing that they would pull their affiliation out %0A of Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind.  %0A  %0A The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing %0A their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they %0A wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise. %0A  %0A Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining %0A 6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks %0A in the New Brunswick city. %0A  %0A The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if %0A the season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold %0A 1400 for this year. %0A ============================================================ %0A SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL %0A The Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of %0A Saint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200 %0A Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion %0A frnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble. %0A ========================================================= %0A CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE %0A Despite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore %0A Skipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks, %0A announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates. %0A There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced %0A a limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players %0A including 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited %0A farm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders. %0A ====================================================== %0A AHL GAME OF THE WEEK %0A In early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced %0A by, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian %0A Maritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of %0A the week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there %0A has been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and %0A shown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic %0A Sports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am not %0A sure if playoff games will be covered. %0A ===================================================== %0A UTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED? %0A There were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next %0A season. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern %0A city and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them. %0A ===================================================== %0A WHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR %0A  %0A ONE OPTION				ANOTHER OPTION %0A 			 %0A Northern Division			Southern Division %0A ADIRONDACK RED WINGS			ADIRONDACK %0A SPRINGFIELD INDIANS			SPRINGFIELD %0A PROVIDENCE BRUINS			PROVIDENCE %0A CD ISLANDERS				CDI %0A PORTLAND PIRATES			HERSHEY %0A 					BINGHAMTON %0A Southern Division			ROCHESTER %0A HERSHEY BEARS				HAMILTON %0A BINGHAMTON RANGERS			UTICA %0A ROCHESTER AMERICANS %0A HAMILTON CANUCKS			Atlantic Division %0A UTICA (?)

This morning I turned on my computer..to be greated with a popping %0A noise from the monitor.  I quickly looked thru the top right vent and to %0A my disbelief saw orange flame and smelled smoke!  Great... %0A I opened it up to see what I could see (it's 4 years old, no warrenty for me). %0A On one of the pc boards there was a resistor that had been majorly %0A fryed..burnt to a crisp..can't even tell what value it is.  This is the %0A only pjhysical damage I can find.  But to my knowledge, resistors don't %0A just randomly blow.  What could have happened??  A voltage regulator %0A problem..?  The fuses nearby are intact...great job.  I have 2 thoughts as %0A to why it did this.  One, over the winter I was ruinning a humidifier for %0A about 6 weeks, although it was halfway across the room.  Could moisture %0A done this?  I last used it over a month ago.  Second, as most people %0A do...I never use the power switches on the CPU or moinitor.  I have %0A everything plugged into a surge protector and I turn the whole shebang on %0A with it.  Now, is this bad???  Should I quit doing it?  Is my system %0A getting too much power or varrying power this way when activated? %0A  %0A Now...before I take it to a repaoir shop I want to replace the resistor to %0A see what happens.  But I have no idea what value it is.  Or even if that %0A would fix things..would it just blow again??  Right now, when I plug it in %0A and turn it on I don't even get the power LED..a power supply prolem?? %0A Should I bother tracking down this resistor value or take it to a shop??  %0A It is resistor R830.  It's near the metal shield that %0A shgields..something..near a large black electrolytic capacitor.  It's on %0A the right most pc board.  The monitor is an Imtec 1455N, from mid-1989. %0A Does someone have schematics for this?  Or would someone be willing to %0A take theirs apart and see what value R830 is???  Basically, what the hell %0A should I do to get this thing fixed for the cheapest amont in the least time. %0A  %0A I have crosposted this article.  Please respond via email with any help or %0A suggestions.  Also, does anyone have Imtecs phone or address??  My manual %0A lacks either from what I can see.  Please respons VIA EMAIL ONLY!!! %0A Needless to say, with no computer I don't have the leisure of scanning %0A groups while bothering my friend to use his computer/modem. %0A Help..this really bites and I need it working ASAP!!! %0A  %0A

No problems.  Got it home and put it on the center stand. %0A  %3A     The next day I pushed it off the center stand in preparation for going %0A  %3A  over to a friend's house to pose.  You guessed it.  It got away from me %0A  %3A  and landed on its right side.   %0A  %3A     Scratched the lower fairing, cracked the right mirror, and cracked the %0A  %3A  upper fairing.   %0A  %3A     *DAMN* am I stupid!  It's going to cost me ~$200 to get the local %0A  %3A  body shop to fix it.

Twenty %0A minutes later, when Jeff's color had paled to a flush, Matty %0A presented him with an estimate of $580 for a busted right mirror %0A and a hairline crack in the fairing.  That was for fixing the crack %0A and masking the damaged area, not a new fairing.

I guessed this would be  a basic condition %0A       for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland) %0A  %0A The US doesn't yet have many laws covering BBSs - they're not common carriers, %0A they're not phone companies, they're just private machines or services %0A operated by businesses.  There's no obligation to keep records. %0A As Perry Metzger points out, if the police come with a search warrant, %0A you have to let them see what the warrant demands, if it exists, %0A and they generally can confiscate the equipment as "evidence" %0A (which is not Constitutionally valid, but we're only beginning to %0A develop court cases supporting us).  A court MAY be able to compel %0A you to tell them information you know, such as the encryption password %0A for the disk - there aren't any definitive cases yet, since it's a new %0A situation, and there probably aren't laws specifically covering it. %0A But the court can't force you to *know* the keys, and there are no %0A laws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keys %0A for their own files without giving them to you. %0A  %0A Even in areas that do have established law, there is uncertainty. %0A There was a guy in Idaho a few years ago who had his business records %0A subpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other business-restriction law, %0A so he gave the court the records.  Which were in Hebrew. %0A The US doesn't have laws forcing you to keep your records in English, %0A and these were the originals of the records.  HE didn't speak Hebrew, %0A and neither did anybody in the court organization.  Don't think they %0A were able to do much about it. %0A  %0A It might be illegal for your BBS to deny access to potential customers %0A based on race, religion, national origin, gender, or sexual preference; %0A it probably hasn't been tested in court, but it seems like a plausible %0A extension of anti-discrimination laws affecting other businesses. %0A  %0A  %0A -- %0A #				Pray for peace;      Bill %0A # Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs %40 anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ %0A #	              No, I'm *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace.... %0A # White House Commect Line 1-202-456-1111  fax 1-202-456-2461 %0A

Since citizens can't be trusted to %0A run their own affairs, the government must watch them.  (for their %0A own good of course. I mean, with strong cryptography, citizens might <gasp!> %0A start to hide things from the IRS, sell drugs/guns/pornography, and %0A that cannot be allowed!) %0A  %0A >trials.

If %0A you believe that your private life (both social and financial) are none of %0A anyone else's business, the difference between socialism and communism is %0A like the difference between murder by lethal injection or by %0A chainsaw. The more centralized the economy is, the more potential %0A abuses for accumulation of information on individuals. If you think %0A credit companies are bad, ...  Well, I'm sure a democratic socialist society %0A would vote for absolute privacy of all citizens -- NOT! %0A

Good thing, because the Blues quit %0A playing. %0A  %0A They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared %0A with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep %0A and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. %0A Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating %0A supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the %0A shot had gone into the net after time had expired. %0A  %0A ``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end," Blues coach Bob Berry said. %0A  %0A If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' %0A disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making %0A the playoffs tempered Berry's anger. %0A  %0A ``It wasn't pretty at the end," he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as %0A good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but %0A it did." %0A  %0A Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end. %0A Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this %0A season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks %0A in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at %0A Chicago Stadium. %0A  %0A The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, %0A their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points %0A behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, %0A which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its %0A first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points. %0A  %0A The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous %0A Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment. %0A  %0A ``It's a shame we let down," said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score %0A two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. %0A ``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have %0A ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy." %0A  %0A Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. %0A ``We won, and that's all that matters," said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 %0A for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play." %0A  %0A Some players didn't have a problem. %0A  %0A ``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit," said Rich %0A Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You %0A can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right. %0A  %0A ``It was disappointing to see what was going on." %0A  %0A Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow, %0A he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss. %0A  %0A ``I didn't know it was final," he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the %0A bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs, %0A and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the %0A end." %0A  %0A The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard %0A operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score %0A showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third %0A period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time. %0A  %0A ``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score," %0A Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took." %0A  %0A If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might %0A bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit. %0A  %0A Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd %0A going at 10 %3A 44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then, %0A Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period. %0A  %0A With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked %0A defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the %0A rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period. %0A  %0A Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski %0A after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone. %0A  %0A Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the  %0A rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of %0A the season and reminded him of a special friend. %0A  %0A Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form %0A of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23. %0A  %0A ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver," Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and %0A I know he was watching. I know he's happy." %0A  %0A Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo %0A at 11 %3A 09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds %0A later, making it 5-1. %0A  %0A Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland %0A scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass %0A from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period. %0A  %0A Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third %0A period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals %0A to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1 %3A 21 midway through the third %0A period. %0A  %0A The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the %0A winner. ``We were in there," Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in." %0A  %0A   %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%* %0A   *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    %  %0A   %   \ \_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    *  %0A   *    \    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    %  %0A   %     \    ________/                                                   * %0A   *      \   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        %  %0A   %       \  \                         Contact for the Blues             * %0A   *        \  \  SAINT LOUIS           jca2 %40 cec1.wustl.edu               %  %0A   %        (___)             BLUES                                       *  %0A   *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%  %0A

Kicking sound %0A  %3A  out of the TV and stereo speakers by direct RF rectification requires a %0A  %3A  mighty strong carrier!  [I've heard of linears so powerful that %0A  %3A  triggering them while the car was idling, would stall the engine by %0A  %3A  pulling down the battery voltage.] %0A  %0A It would take a lot more than that. It sounds like the radio equipment is %0A actually not shut completely off - but just goes to a standby situation. %0A  %0A I suspect that the stories are just that, stories.  The voltage can only %0A be sucked down so far instantaneously. When you try to jumpstart someones  %0A car, when your vehicle is at idle, does your car stall? No, the other car %0A just does not crank well.  Now, the engine might stall because the idle %0A was too low to start with.

If surges are %0A occurring there, it is due to another cause - not a transmitter. %0A  %0A  %3A  Unfortunately, there's a fair chance that enough signal is being picked %0A  %3A  up by your house wiring that a simple service-panel filter won't %0A  %3A  suffice.  You may need to install heavy-duty RFI filters at the power %0A  %3A  connections of your affected equipment. %0A  %0A It is probably not that much of a problem.

If you can identify the vehicle which %0A  %3A  is transmitting, you may be able to contact its owner and complain. %0A  %0A It is probably not the transmitter that is at fault.

Since we apparently %0A don't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing %0A cameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests %0A are going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the %0A video being piped into a command center they're building %0A somewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or %0A cheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large %0A multi-colored status displays will show the various routes %0A using different colors to represent the various average speeds %0A for each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front %0A of the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic %0A status to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also %0A looking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to %0A providing continuous audio from this system. %0A  %0A In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display %0A boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data %0A on traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the %0A system is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it %0A will be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is %0A similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read %0A "cheap"). %0A  %0A We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP %0A audio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal %0A reports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle %0A receivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is %0A applicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some %0A other TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your %0A stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station %0A jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information. %0A I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle %0A receivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly %0A fees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers %0A don't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely %0A true), they likely have no investment in keeping the system %0A up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You %0A may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing %0A more, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;) %0A  %0A I think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more %0A info on how the LA system is networked and paid for. %0A  %0A Cheers, %0A Alan %0A <acooney %40 netcom.com> %0A  %0A

As far as I'm concerned, there's no %0A   amp which can touch it at the price range. %0A The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other  %0A   amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid %0A   with massive heat sinks and very solid casing. %0A If you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components  %0A   in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect %0A   symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each %0A   channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are %0A   virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good. %0A  %0A I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east %0A   or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components %0A   they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the %0A   amplifiers sound so brilliant. %0A I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with %0A   those quality components inside.

So the %0A   proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part  %0A   in three thousand to be cost-effective.  %0A  %0A BACKGROUND %0A  %0A Until now, phones have happened to allow the existence of "wiretaps", %0A detectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line.  And over %0A time, law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to %0A aid in criminal investigations.  However, powerful new encryption %0A technologies threaten this status quo, by making possible truly %0A private communication.  A small chip in each phone could soon make it %0A literally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical %0A microphones at either end. %0A  %0A In order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap %0A phone conversations, the U.S. government announced on April 16, 1993 %0A that it had developed and begun manufacturing a special "wiretap" chip %0A to be placed in future phones, instead of the total privacy chips %0A which have been under private development.  The same day, AT&T %0A announced it would use these chips "in all its secure telephone %0A products". %0A  %0A Each chip would be created under government supervision, when it would %0A be given a fixed indentifier and encryption key.  Periodically during %0A each conversation, the chip would broadcast its identifier and other %0A info in a special "law enforcement block".  Law enforcement officers %0A with a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the %0A indentifier from special trust agencies, and could thereby listen in %0A on any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone. %0A  %0A To date, most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its %0A security.  The government won't disclose the encryption algorithm, and %0A many suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it %0A has claimed.  The track record of previous governments does not %0A inspire confidence on this point [1]. %0A  %0A However, this paper will neglect these concerns, and ask instead %0A whether this new wiretap chip is a cost-effective tool for police %0A investigation.  That is, which is a cheaper way for society to %0A investigate crime %3A  force phone communications to support wiretaps, or %0A give police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways? %0A Or to put it another way, would police agencies be willing to pay for %0A each wiretap, if they had to pay their share of the full social cost %0A of forcing phones to support wiretaps? %0A  %0A To start to answer this question, we might compare the current %0A benefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected %0A costs of implementing the new wiretap chip plan.  And since current %0A benefits are easier to estimate, we begin there. %0A  %0A WIRETAP BENEFITS %0A  %0A 1990 is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available %0A [2].  In that year, 872 wiretap installations were requested, and no %0A requests were denied.  (This figure does not include wiretaps obtained %0A with the consent of a party to the conversation.)  2057 arrests %0A resulted from wiretaps started the same year, 1486 arrests came from %0A wiretaps in previous years, and 55% of arrests led to convictions. %0A 76% of the wiretaps were for phones (vs pagers, email, etc.), 60% were %0A regarding drug offenses, and 40% were requested by federal %0A authorities.  Each wiretap installation heard an average of 1487 %0A calls, 22% of them incriminating, among 131 people, and cost an %0A average of $45,125 (extrapolating from the 794 installations %0A reporting costs), mostly for labor. %0A  %0A Thus a total of about $40 Million was spent on wiretaps, to obtain %0A about 4000 arrests, at $10,000 per arrest.  Thus these arrests are at %0A least four times more expensive than the $2500 per arrest figure one %0A gets by dividing the $28 Billion spent by all police nationally by the %0A total 11 Million non-traffic arrests [3].  Thus the $30 Million per %0A year spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police %0A expenditures.  And if we divide this by the 138 Million phone "access" %0A lines in the country [3], we get about 23 cents spent per year per %0A phone line, or about two cents a month. %0A  %0A In general, we deter a given class of criminals through a combination %0A of a perceived probability of being caught and convicted, and some %0A expected punishment level if convicted.  So the social value of having %0A wiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get %0A the same criminal deterrence through other means.  If unable to %0A wiretap a particular suspect's phone, police might instead use hidden %0A microphones, or investigate that suspect in other ways.  Or police %0A might focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps.  Or %0A we might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime. %0A  %0A If we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be %0A on average twice as expensive as wiretaps, then the annual social %0A benefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level %0A of two cents a month per phone line. %0A  %0A WIRETAP COSTS %0A  %0A Let us for the moment optimistically assume that the US government %0A encryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would %0A have offered instead, protecting our conversations from the spying %0A ears of neighbors, corporations, and governments, both foreign and %0A domestic.  Even so, the need to support wiretaps would add many %0A additional costs to build and maintain our communication system. %0A  %0A Extra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions, %0A increasing traffic by some unknown percentage.  A special process must %0A be used to add encryption keys to chips, while securely distributing %0A these keys to special agencies, which must be funded and monitored. %0A The chips themselves are designed by a military contractor, whose %0A design is to remain secret, and are manufactured through a special %0A process so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart. %0A (Chips are now offered at the relatively high price of $30 a peice in %0A lots of 10,000 [4].)  Private encryption systems not supporting %0A wiretaps would require none of these extra costs. %0A  %0A Perhaps most important, government degree would at least partially %0A replace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to %0A be represented, encrypted, and exchanged in our future phones.  It is %0A widely believed that governments are less efficient than private %0A enterprise in procuring products and standards, though they may perhaps %0A perform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private %0A standards.  How much less efficient is a matter of debate, some say %0A they pay twice as much, while others might say only 10% more.     %0A  %0A Currently, a total of $96 Billion is spent as operating expenses of %0A U.S. phone companies [3], which comes out to about $60 per month per %0A access line.  If we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per %0A month, we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even %0A as much as one part in 3000, then wiretaps are not cost effective! %0A And this doesn't even include extra costs phone owners pay because %0A their encryption chips are more expensive.  Of course most phones %0A wouldn't have encryption chips for a while, but the wiretap benefit %0A per phone is still the same, so this argument still applies. %0A  %0A CONCLUSION %0A  %0A Given this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the %0A phone system and the value of wiretaps, we can justify only the %0A slightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps. %0A When the only modification required was to allow investigators in to %0A attach clips to phone wires, wiretap support may have been reasonable. %0A But when we consider substantial modification, the burden of proof is %0A clearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs %0A would really be less than the benefits.   %0A  %0A If consensus cannot be obtain on this cost/benefit estimate, a %0A compromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a %0A rate of say five cents per month, a tax payable to police agencies %0A nationwide to compensate them for their loss of wiretap abilities. %0A  %0A [1] The Invisible Weapon, Oxford Press, ISBN 0-19-506273-6 %0A  %0A [2] Report on Applications for Orders Authorizing or Approving the %0A     Interception of Wire, Oral, or Electronic Communications, 1990, %0A     Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, Washington, DC 20544. %0A  %0A [3] U.S. Statistical Abstracts, 1992.   %0A  %0A [4] Dorothy Denning, "The Clipper Chip %3A  A Technical Summary", %0A     distributed to sci.crypt newsgroup April 21, 1993.  %0A --  %0A Robin Hanson  hanson %40 ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov  %0A 415-604-3361  MS-269-2, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035 %0A 510-651-7483  47164 Male Terrace, Fremont, CA  94539-7921  %0A

The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which %0A     much of the net community has settled. Please DON'T bring them up again %0A     unless there's something truly new to be discussed. The net can't set %0A     public policy, that's what your representatives are for. %0A  %0A  %0A     WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS %0A  %0A     Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints %0A     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on %0A     microfilm. %0A  %0A     The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it %0A     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like %0A     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB %0A     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch %0A     from. %0A  %0A     By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify %0A     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean %0A     sheet design. %0A  %0A  %0A     WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE %0A  %0A     Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access %0A     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an %0A     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being %0A     "scooped" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently %0A     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early %0A     in a mission. %0A  %0A  %0A     RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES %0A  %0A     There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to %0A     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium %0A     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in %0A     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental %0A     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small. %0A     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2 %0A     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather %0A     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months %0A     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar %0A     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which %0A     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in %0A     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are %0A     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10 %0A     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980]. %0A  %0A     To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to %0A     pursue are %3A  %0A  %0A     A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel %0A     Salisbury in "Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG %0A     Controversy," *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7. Another good %0A     article, which also reviews the events preceding Galileo's launch, %0A     "Showdown at Pad 39-B," by Robert G.

Studies %0A     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in %0A     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The %0A     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted %0A     study, Charles Jackman. %0A  %0A     The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the %0A     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was %0A     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space %0A     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia %0A     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space %0A     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and %0A     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects %0A     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere. %0A  %0A     The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine %3A  %0A  %0A        Industrial sources %3A     300,000,000 kilograms/year %0A 	  Natural sources %3A      75,000,000 kilograms/year %0A 	  Shuttle sources %3A 	  725,000 kilograms/year %0A  %0A     The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are %0A     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the %0A     total stratospheric chlorine sources. %0A  %0A     The effect on ozone is minimal %3A   global yearly average total ozone would %0A     be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability %0A     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares. %0A  %0A     The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed %0A     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally %0A     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and %0A     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch %0A     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be %0A     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about %0A     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons %0A     do at the present time. %0A  %0A     Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space %0A     Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR %0A     Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Holding your %0A     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to %0A     watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your %0A     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal %0A     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no %0A     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do %0A     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness. %0A  %0A     Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly "the bends", certainly some %0A     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue) %0A     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from %0A     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes, %0A     you're dying.

This is %0A     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example. %0A     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank %0A     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the %0A     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin %0A     team's medical/forensic report. %0A  %0A     The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the %0A     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks %0A     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team %0A     examined them, they were sent off to be buried. %0A  %0A  %0A     USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT %0A  %0A     You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit %0A     because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry %0A     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks. %0A  %0A     Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of %0A     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in %0A     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly %0A     specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it %0A     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would %0A     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit %0A     spacecraft. %0A  %0A     [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.] %0A  %0A  %0A     THE "FACE ON MARS" %0A  %0A     There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid %0A     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery %3A  %0A     35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often %0A     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13 %0A     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west). %0A  %0A     Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is %0A     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an %0A     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the %0A     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a %0A     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere %0A     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't %0A     know the address) to study the Face. %0A  %0A     The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution %0A     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this %0A     question in a few years.

On the other side of the piston %0A is hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens %0A of atmospheres. %0A  %0A The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until %0A a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi. %0A The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch %0A bore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they %0A intersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel %0A could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to %0A move the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used %0A in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter %0A and about 50 cm long. %0A  %0A All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen %0A gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the %0A barrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a %0A sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The %0A plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped %0A in the barrel ahead of the projectile.   %0A  %0A The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic %0A water jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic %0A projectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing, %0A the projectile vaporizes. %0A  %0A The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is %0A about 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km %0A if fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun %0A to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can %0A fire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB %0A to follow the projectiles. %0A  %0A The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 %0A km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s, %0A and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test %0A they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it %0A had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but %0A I haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this). %0A  %0A There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this %0A gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12= %0A 4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8. %0A  %0A This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically %0A a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful- %0A sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of %0A 100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg %0A useful payload to orbit. %0A  %0A Dani Eder %0A  %0A --  %0A Dani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/ %0A Rt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location %3A  34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt. %0A

Tell us, what happens if I were to say OK, I want to have %0A something else.  If the law enforcement wants my traffic, they can record %0A it, then get a search warrant, and get the keys FROM ME, just like they %0A would the keys to a stout private safe, etc. (Lets say I suspect that %0A there is a way to trivially crack this at the Fed level, with no warrant, %0A say for NSA scanning for keywords, etc., and the government has abused %0A great power in the past...). %0A  %0A So I say "Mr Vendor, I want something different, independent.  I am %0A a paranoid sort, ya understand...". %0A  %0A Will the result be "Sorry, without Government permission, we cannot sell %0A you anything secure", or would it be "Sorry, we know which side our %0A bread is buttered on, we cannot sell except to government people, law %0A enforcement, and 'special' people...". %0A  %0A What, in your opinion, would be the chances of "sure, we will sell you %0A this secure system ... be happy to..." %0A  %0A Also, please be so kind as to tell us what the plans are for private %0A encryption of, say files transferred by modem, or FTP, or data stored %0A on disk?  SURELY you have a feel for what the administration is planning %0A for us people on that....  With your rather intimate relationship with %0A the FBI, NSA, etc. you must CERTAINLY have an idea.  You are surely %0A not going to say "the people are not to know, until it is too late..." %0A This IS supposed to be government of the people by the PEOPLE, isn't %0A it?  That is, the people ARE the government's BOSSES?  The BOSSES %0A want to know what the * %40 ()#*&( %40  is going on here... %0A  %0A You see, I am kind of nervous, because in the last month or so, I have %0A seen a non-stop stream of ideas coming out of Wash DC that at least %0A appear VERY STRONGLY to have a common trait to limit privacy (freedom %0A from Govt eavesdropping), and the ability to defend ourselves against %0A violent attack (no, 911 is *NOT* good enough for 'common folk', they %0A arrive only in time to clean up the mess %3A  I would be DEAD if I had to %0A depend on 911...).   You see, with all that talk about National smart %0A ID cards, limiting of encryption to 'government approved', denial of %0A means to effective personal defense (EIGHT bills in congress right now), %0A it looks an AWFULLY lot like the whole thing is to be able to trace %0A EVERY ACTIVITY of an individual from cradle to grave.  All it would take %0A is requiring that National ID card to be used in all transactions... %0A and with no effective data protection, and with the people suitably %0A disarmed, there would not be a helluva lot they could do about it, now %0A would there?  All in the name of the War on the Constitu ... er ... %0A drugs, and of course that catch word 'terrorists'.  What is wrong with %0A good OLD-FASHIONED POLICE WORK to build a case?  They don't want to %0A have to be burdened to leave the office, it seems... %0A  %0A Please read the Bill of Rights (first ten amendments to the US %0A Constitution) and tell us how you can reconcile this Big Brother-ish %0A policy of the Administration (always for a 'crisis' of some kind, isn't %0A it?) with that Bill of Rights in the context of the people who wrote %0A it? %0A  %0A Reassure us - please... (or is that no longer regarded as necessary, %0A seeing as apparantly the people have NO input on this agenda, the %0A Administration preferring to make all the DECISIONS in secret, then %0A springing it on us...).  Doesn't sound much like ... by the PEOPLE %0A to me.  I cannot help notice that the congress people involved were %0A NOT mentioned on the press release.  I find that more than a little %0A bit curious, don't you?  I sure would like to know who to not vote %0A for come election time... %0A  %0A Yes, I am upset.  I feel you are a part of this, because I recall it %0A was you that was posting HEAVILY in favor of a very similar idea (could %0A have been the SAME thing, it was so close) a few months ago...  I %0A also recall it was not well received.  Apparantly powers-that-be %0A really didn't care (or were not told, or both). %0A  %0A From what I see, Clipper will ONLY be useful for conversations I don't %0A want the neighborhood kid listening in on.  Any SERIOUS security I don't %0A think I would want to trust it a bit.  Might as well use cleartext. %0A Certainly corporations would be rather dumb to depend on this for serious %0A trade-secret data, especially if millions depended on that security. %0A Given enough money, one could BUY any keys they wanted.  Buy a crooked %0A judge, and a crooked cop.   Given a few hundred thou, they wouldn't be %0A hard to find.  So, we end up with only criminals, terrorists, and the %0A Government with real security, and the ability to eavesdrop.  You know %0A the first two, if they are serious, ain't going to use this thing for %0A THEIR communications.  I bet the government won't, either (except perhaps %0A to order a pizza). %0A  %0A Tell us, will that be prima face evidence of criminal activity, %0A someone not using the 'government approved' methods?  That just a desire %0A to have PRIVACY is no longer regarded as a legitimate right of an %0A unconnected citizen?  Will that be grounds for a fly-through-the-door %0A raid, and confiscation of all one's equipment, as 'terrorist tools', %0A using civil forfeiture, so there will be no inconvenient need to %0A PROVE any wrongdoing on the part of the citizen? %0A  %0A I have yet another question, are we going to see articles in all the %0A public magazines, consisting of soothing text telling us how great %0A this is, how nice the government is by LETTING us have this illusion %0A of privacy?  That the government is going to be so kind as to let %0A us 'sort of' exercise a RIGHT?  What you want to bet that I am %0A correct here? %0A  %0A Please answer these questions.  As citizens of the United States, we %0A hava a RIGHT to know what our Government plans to 'let' us have %0A out of the goodness of their hearts... %0A  %0A Funny thing, though - with all these proposals, I don't feel ONE BIT %0A safer from drug dealers, terrorists, or a common street thug.  I am %0A beginning to wonder if the greater danger lies in the above entities, %0A or our own government gone out of control? %0A  %0A Re-assure us, please.

We grew %0A up in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles, %0A nuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were %0A miracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the pundits %0A have told us - "you've lost it!"  The "me" generation is only %0A living on the accomplishments of the past. %0A  %0A      You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We %0A listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living %0A history they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell %0A of it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as %0A General Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle %0A - to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. %0A  %0A      What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand %0A dollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only %0A of that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen. %0A Schriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the %0A best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and %0A Poseidon ballistic missiles. %0A  %0A      Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing.  %0A This event is proof.  To our technological parents %3A  We've listened %0A to your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit.  %0A And we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let %0A me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus %0A behind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest %0A engineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your %0A insight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated %0A into today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta. %0A  %0A      You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - a %0A single stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You %0A advocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are %0A all great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You %0A convinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld %0A its components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a %0A prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the %0A generation before you - the generation that built transcontinental %0A aviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a little %0A and Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who %0A started this program for the SDI. %0A  %0A      Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't even %0A start with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a %0A little - even sold a little and made a little money - before they %0A moved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or more %0A before putting the first "rubber on the road."  Max Hunter - you %0A didn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going to %0A take ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable %0A aerospace transportation is real. %0A  %0A      We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same %0A team here today but a few years to show through the Strategic %0A Defense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us - %0A launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about %0A a year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our %0A commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet %0A Union.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored %0A the importance of our work in bringing about a new international %0A relationship. %0A  %0A      But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the %0A framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the %0A next generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable. %0A  %0A      We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This %0A summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the %0A first time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three %0A years a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space %0A rapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And %0A yes - we'll make a little money off it too! %0A  %0A      Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years to %0A build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of %0A space will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the %0A rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries.  %0A What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to %0A counter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars! %0A  %0A      To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to %0A the final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't Saturn %0A V's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra %0A dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital %0A system - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the %0A way.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket %0A exhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the %0A world again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at %0A hand! %0A  %0A      This project is real.  The torch of American technological %0A greatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine is %0A American.  Let's go fly it! %0A

Keep boxing the compass chaps, you`ll %0A get round to it eventually. %0A  %0A The Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship, %0A with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. The Great Eastern, which broke %0A the 'Little Giant' financially and otherwise, was a revolutionary leap %0A forward in ship design. A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel, with %0A primary steam propulsion, it was at the time easily the biggest ocean %0A going vessel ever built. Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo %0A and / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale, while drag rose %0A with the square, so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles %0A without coaling. %0A  %0A Unfortunately, there was no real market for such a beast at the time, %0A and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. As another poster %0A said, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable %0A laying ship. It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying %0A a transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity to %0A carry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for %0A defective sections. See Arthur C Clarke`s book "How the World was One" %0A [ I think that`s right ] %0A  %0A If that`s how the Shuttle goes down in history, as a technical triumph %0A and a financial disaster for the builder, it would not be entirely %0A ignoble, but I doubt if history will be so charitable.  Its true the %0A Shuttle can do things no other launch system can do, but are they %0A worth doing? With low cost access to space, you could have an %0A affordable space station for doing shuttle-like extended manned %0A missions.

At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous %0A     pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near %0A     Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part %0A     was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They %0A     were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became %0A     enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle %0A     of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby %0A     forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were %0A     visible till morning sunrise. %0A  %0A     The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in %0A     Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in %0A     the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was %0A     only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller. %0A     A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a %0A     spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about %0A     five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the %0A     upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop %0A     became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of %0A     the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright %0A     spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails %0A     were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still %0A     visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky. %0A  %0A     The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if %0A     there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near %0A     Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969 %0A     we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland.

Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he %0A proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their %0A arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal, %0A while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they %0A are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all, %0A nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by %0A extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of %0A the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while %0A the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties %0A and dangers should receive advantages.   %0A  %0A 	When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by %0A showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you %0A distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you. %0A Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would %0A have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been %0A discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be %0A good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful %0A subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired %0A state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is %0A full of examples proving that this is so. %0A  %0A 	But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he %0A annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all %0A the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire %0A it; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render %0A soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of %0A the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to %0A his original domain. %0A  %0A 	... %0A  %0A 	And since the subject demands it, I will not fail to remind %0A any prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants %0A that he soundly consider what induced them to assist him; if the %0A reason is not natural affection for him, but rather dissatisfaction %0A with the former government, he will find it extremely difficult to %0A keep them friendly, for it will be impossible to please them.  If he %0A will carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawn %0A from ancient and modern affairs, he will understand why it is much %0A easier to win the favor of those who were happy with their former %0A government, and hence were his enemies, than to keep the favor of %0A those who, out of dissatisfaction with the former rule, helped him to %0A replace it. %0A  %0A  %0A  %0A  %0A

Ahola had %0A only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose %0A Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he %0A has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been %0A spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points); %0A it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn %0A out to be ... Peter Ahola. %0A  %0A #24	DOUG WILSON		Season %3A  16th %0A Acquired %3A 	'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and %0A 		2nd round pick in '92 entry draft %0A Grade %3A 		I (B) %0A  %0A I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high %0A expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out. %0A Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and %0A playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which, %0A unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to %0A catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for %0A 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be %0A Wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor. %0A  %0A #29	DEAN KOLSTAD		Season %3A 	2nd %0A Acquired %3A 	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft %0A Grade %3A 		I (C-/D+) %0A  %0A It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of %0A games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's %0A quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games, %0A he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of %0A the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with %0A the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward %0A with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in %0A his level of performance to have any chance of making the team. %0A  %0A #38	PAT MACLEOD		Season %3A  2nd %0A Acquired %3A 	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft %0A Grade %3A 		I (?) %0A  %0A MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my %0A memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to %0A use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that %0A he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with %0A Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment, %0A a "rehab assignment" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs. %0A Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but %0A he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive %0A skills. %0A  %0A #41	TOM PEDERSON		Season %3A  1st %0A Acquired %3A 	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft %0A Grade %3A 		I (B+) %0A  %0A Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated %0A by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours %0A truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in %0A 43 games.  However, his size (5' 9", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after %0A he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically, %0A on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach. %0A But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance %0A on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league. %0A  %0A #45	CLAUDIO SCREMIN		Season %3A  1st %0A Acquired %3A 	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft %0A Grade %3A 		I (D+/D) %0A  %0A He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly %0A umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a %0A small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is %0A quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or %0A defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that %0A will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he %0A was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre. %0A  %0A =============================================================================== %0A GO CALGARY FLAMES!

The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale  %0A experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded. %0A  %0A On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled  %0A "Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions" here at the University of %0A Illinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and %0A determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is %0A not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with  %0A them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used  %0A the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the details %0A of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope %0A they aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will %0A be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples. %0A  %0A The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The %0A main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that %0A this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I %0A did not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters %0A and 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in  %0A mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson %0A showed the following plot of acceleration vs time %3A  %0A                   ______ %0A 3 G         /%7C   /      %7C %0A            / %7C  /       %7C          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly  %0A           /  %7C /        %7C	   good.  The big difference is that the lines %0A 2 G      /   %7C/         %7C          made by the  /  should be curves which are %0A         /               %7C          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as %0A        /                %7C          the graph wasn't up for very long. %0A 1 G   /                 %7C %0A                         %7C %0A                         %7C %0A 0 G                     %7C %0A  %0A              ^          ^ %0A            ~100 sec    ~400 sec %0A  %0A  %0A As mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below %0A 3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the %0A accelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are  %0A throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it %0A soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in  %0A accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines %0A bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut %0A out entirely. %0A  %0A The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed %0A for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of %0A air drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to  %0A that desired. %0A  %0A Questions from the audience %3A   (paraphrased) %0A  %0A Q %3A   Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than %0A     all at once? %0A  %0A A %3A   Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given. %0A  %0A Q %3A   So what was the final payload for this trajectory? %0A  %0A A %3A   Can't tell us.  "Read Aviation Leak."  He also apparently had a good  %0A     propulsion example, but was told not to use it.   %0A  %0A My question %3A   Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting %0A national security or MD protecting their own interests? %0A  %0A The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch %0A up maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and  %0A the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs %0A of heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar, %0A and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate. %0A The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have %0A about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about  %0A 60 degrees south latitude. %0A  %0A I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about that %0A aspect of the flight profile. %0A  %0A --  %0A Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289 %40 uxa.cso.uiuc.edu %0A 		    "Find a way or make one." %0A 	             -attributed to Hannibal %0A

How do I become an astronaut? %0A  %0A     A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably %0A     impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying %0A     passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have %0A     so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to %0A     win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet %0A     experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you %0A     want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle "mission %0A     specialist". %0A  %0A     If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that, %0A     the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly %0A     exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people, %0A     but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	It is not enough %0A     to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason, %0A     many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job. %0A  %0A     Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands %0A     dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer %0A     programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore- %0A     seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in %0A     another seems to be a frequent winner. %0A  %0A     Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(DO NOT get a %0A     radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows %0A     what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term %0A     effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other %0A     significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical, %0A     you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor. %0A  %0A     Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in %0A     appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying %0A     to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you %0A     are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you %0A     will be a credit to NASA after you are hired %3A   public relations is %0A     a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and %0A     proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie. %0A     Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point, %0A     and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent. %0A     Keep your nose clean. %0A  %0A     Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby; %0A     experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs. %0A  %0A     Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988, %0A     43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were %0A     a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut). %0A     If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job %0A     at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant "you %0A     do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first". %0A  %0A     Think space %3A   they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance %0A     to demonstrate motivation. %0A  %0A     Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time. %0A  %0A  %0A  %0A  %0A     NASA %0A     National Aeronautics and Space Administration %0A     Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center %0A     Houston, Texas %0A  %0A     Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates %0A     ================================================================== %0A  %0A     Astronaut Candidate Program %0A     --------------------------- %0A  %0A     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for %0A     Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates %0A     to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a %0A     continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed. %0A  %0A     Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be %0A     considered. %0A  %0A     All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in %0A     Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation %0A     program. %0A  %0A     Space Shuttle Program Description %0A     --------------------------------- %0A  %0A     The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated %0A     that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming %0A     routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in %0A     the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then %0A     returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and %0A     flight crew. %0A  %0A     The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment %0A     and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation %0A     of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials %0A     processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will %0A     eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space %0A     station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher %0A     orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space %0A     Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include %0A     government agencies and private industries. %0A  %0A     The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot, %0A     and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are %0A     assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA %0A     astronauts. %0A  %0A     Pilot Astronaut %0A  %0A     Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots. %0A     During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle, %0A     crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the %0A     commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the %0A     pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing %0A     the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other %0A     payload operations. %0A  %0A     Mission Specialist Astronaut %0A  %0A     Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot, %0A     have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations %0A     in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and %0A     experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to %0A     have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed %0A     knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and %0A     objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the %0A     experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission %0A     specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling %0A     using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific %0A     experimental operations. %0A  %0A     Astronaut Candidate Program %0A     =========================== %0A  %0A     Basic Qualification Requirements %0A     -------------------------------- %0A  %0A     Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to %0A     submitting an application. %0A  %0A     Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate %3A  %0A  %0A     1.

When NASA %0A     decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be %0A     given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is %0A     made. Applications received after that date will be retained and %0A     considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually %0A     of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate %0A     continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants %0A     who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from %0A     consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the %0A     preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be %0A     requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as %0A     supervisors and references may be contacted. %0A  %0A     Active Duty Military %0A  %0A     Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their %0A     respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application %0A     procedures will be disseminated by each service. %0A  %0A     Selection %0A     --------- %0A  %0A     Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required %0A     for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration. %0A     Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered %0A     will be notified of the outcome of the process. %0A  %0A     Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the %0A     selection of additional candidates during a one year period following %0A     their establishment. %0A  %0A     General Program Requirements %0A  %0A     Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be %0A     assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, %0A     Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and %0A     evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or %0A     scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to %0A     ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut %0A     training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills %0A     required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot %0A     astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during %0A     their candidate period. %0A  %0A     Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does %0A     not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut %0A     will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and %0A     evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the %0A     training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become %0A     permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for %0A     a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not %0A     selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA %0A     depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that %0A     time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a %0A     specified tour of duty. %0A  %0A     NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified %0A     minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates. %0A     Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply. %0A  %0A     Pay and Benefits %0A     ---------------- %0A  %0A     Civilians %0A  %0A     Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal %0A     Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14, %0A     and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements %0A     and experience. %0A  %0A     Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and %0A     participation in group health and life insurance plans. %0A  %0A     Military %0A  %0A     Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center %0A     but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and %0A     other similar military matters. %0A  %0A  %0A NEXT %3A  FAQ #15/15 - Orbital and Planetary Launch Services %0A

doc_3606 |@raw_text From %3A  wtm %40 uhura.neoucom.edu (Bill Mayhew) %0A Subject %3A  Re %3A  Laser vs Bubblejet? %0A Message-ID %3A  <1993Apr26.153312.10415 %40 uhura.neoucom.edu> %0A Organization %3A  Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine %0A References %3A  <735446880snx %40 black.demon.co.uk> %0A Date %3A  Mon, 26 Apr 1993 15 %3A 33 %3A 12 GMT %0A Lines %3A  90 %0A  %0A There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers %0A available from hewlett-packard.  Older original deskjet and %0A possibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with %0A rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right %0A side (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a %0A gray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow %0A your cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information %0A packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a %0A coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new %0A capping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find %0A that the cartidges now last longer. %0A  %0A I don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your %0A nearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit. %0A  %0A HP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical %0A components that vary depending on the starting level printer and %0A the level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original %0A desket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are %0A likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new %0A deskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an %0A original deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no %0A soldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping %0A the processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP %0A service center for further information. %0A  %0A The PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from %0A the PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser %0A printers.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a %0A raster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material %0A difference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the %0A accumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously %0A slow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are %0A still guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect %0A works, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works %0A efficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'. %0A  %0A The PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that %0A permits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one %0A megabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as %0A about 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for %0A its internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded %0A printing that allows incrmental download of the image with %0A compression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable %0A fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts. %0A  %0A A single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This %0A is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet %0A printer.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer %0A has completed its warm-up cyle. %0A  %0A Until ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image %0A deterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but %0A matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely. %0A Chosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the %0A problem. %0A  %0A Laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable %0A components.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges, %0A mitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste %0A could use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing %0A stand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the %0A laserjet IV. %0A  %0A Kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous %0A silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image %0A drum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice %0A print engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has %0A a neat modular paper source and stacker system. %0A  %0A The recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower %0A than any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are %0A subject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The %0A usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper. %0A The paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a %0A single part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is %0A almost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable, %0A though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician. %0A I have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer. %0A  %0A It depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If %0A you only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the %0A appearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted, %0A the deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use. %0A  %0A  %0A --  %0A Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department %0A Rootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone %3A  216-325-2511 %0A wtm %40 uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580 %3A  N8WED %0A

I think %0A it was also shown during the Calgary-LA game.  %0A  %0A (Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.) %0A  %0A Topics %0A ------ %0A  %0A Don's Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo, %0A Wendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork. %0A  %0A Episode Summary %0A --------------- %0A  %0A Once again, the episode started with a shot of Don's tie... This %0A was a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the %0A characters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the %0A Cat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc. %0A  %0A Ron Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs %0A game. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players "They %0A won in their building, we're going to win in ours". %0A  %0A Don then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour %0A has never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he %0A got 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that %0A he gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible %0A for his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour %0A from the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk %0A resulting in a goal. %0A  %0A On the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in %0A the first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed %0A however, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells %0A the Leaf players "Don't let them score on you". %0A  %0A Ron brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note %3A  Montreal %0A won that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner %0A disqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don %0A thought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of %0A instant replay. %0A  %0A On the Buffalo-Boston series [Note %3A  Buffalo is currently winning %0A the series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr. %0A Fuhr should be getting 1/2 the team's playoff checks for his %0A play. %0A  %0A Wendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance %0A during the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying %0A that he can't play the way he should, because of the league's %0A new rules. "This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its %0A all hack and slash." Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the %0A problems. %0A  %0A Don's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings %0A GM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray %0A was shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination %0A of fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article %0A in which Murray makes the following statements %3A  "Players don't fight %0A because they're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator. %0A Instead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing %0A each other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there %0A wouldn't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game." %0A  %0A Don warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to "smarten up" with %0A fighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used %0A to be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights, %0A someone gets cut every period. %0A  %0A Rating %0A ------ %0A Typical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don's opinion is supported %0A by Murray. %0A  %0A I'd give it a 7.0 out of 10. %0A

Clarke %0A  %0A Krieger Publishing Company %0A Melbourne, Florida, USA %0A Orig. Ed. 1993 %0A Pre-publication $84.50 %0A ISBN 0-89464-039-9 %0A  %0A  %0A This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a %0A technological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the %0A space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the %0A tlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make %0A such a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized %0A that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to %0A reach them.    %0A  %0A Tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient, %0A attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of %0A technology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel %0A became feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed %0A than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that %0A matter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason %0A as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are %3A   they are all accurate %0A reflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and %0A knowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as %0A well as selected events important in developing the idea of %0A extraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological %0A entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and %0A speculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between %0A simultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal %0A connections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every %0A entry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every %0A spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This %0A allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize %0A differences, similarities, and influences. %0A  %0A This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history, %0A and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic %0A diagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and %0A historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The %0A unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and %0A very interesting history of the spaceship. %0A  %0A SPECIAL FEATURES %0A  %0A Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and %0A fictional %0A  %0A Contains scores of illustrations %3A  artwork, drawings, and photos %0A contemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare %0A illustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and %0A drawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and %0A obscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA %0A archives %0A  %0A An index, bibliography, and appendices are included. %0A  %0A CONTENTS %0A  %0A Part I  The Archaeology of the Spaceship (360 B.C. to 1783 A.D.) %0A Part II The invention of the Spaceship (1784-1899) %0A Part III The Experimenters (1900-1938) %0A Part IV The World War (1939-1945) %0A Part V  The Golden Age of the Spaceship (1946-1960) %0A Part VI The Dawn of the Space Age (1961 to the present) %0A  %0A ABOUT RON MILLER %0A  %0A [The brochure has a page of stuff here; I'll try to hit the high %0A spots.] %0A  %0A Former art director for Albert Einstein Planetarium  at Smithsonian's %0A National Air and Space Museum %0A  %0A Member of International Association for Astronomical Arts, member of %0A International Astronautical Association, Fellow of the British %0A Interplanetary Society,  consulting editor for *Air & Space %0A Smithsonian* magazine %0A  %0A Author, co-author, editor, or sole illustrator on many books since %0A 1979, including *Space Art*, *Cycles of Fire*, *The Grand Tour*, and %0A many others, as well as many articles and papers %0A  %0A Book jackets and interior art for over a dozen publishers  %0A  %0A Contributor to IBM traveling exhibition and book *Blueprint for Space* %0A  %0A Production illustrator for movies *Dune* and *Total Recall* %0A  %0A Designer of ten-stamp set of commemorative space postage stamps for %0A U.S. Postal Service in 1991 (Solar System Exploration) %0A  %0A ORDERING INFORMATION %0A  %0A Pre-publication price $84.50 before 1 May 1993 %0A Afterwards, price will be $112.50 %0A  %0A Krieger Publishing Company %0A PO Box 9542 %0A Melbourne, FL 32902-9542 %0A USA %0A Direct order line (407)727-7270 %0A Fax (407)951-3671 %0A  %0A Add $5.00 for shipping by UPS within USA for first book, $1.50 for each %0A additional book.   %0A  %0A For foreign orders, add $6.00 for first book, $2.00 for each %0A additional.

It's called RADAR. %0A Well, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances %0A by measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive its %0A reflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters %0A use either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of %0A the latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example, %0A the original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500 %0A feet altitude. %0A  %0A Note, however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster %0A originally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements between %0A a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate %0A time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter %0A triggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually %0A travel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the difference %0A is called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to a %0A common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Something %0A like a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering both %0A the transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad, %0A but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort. %0A  %0A Why not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again %0A the reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E. %0A should know about anyway ;-). %0A  %0A >> Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength %0A >> and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft), %0A >> and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so. %0A  %0A This is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmitter %0A varies from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmission %0A line, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit %0A over time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. With %0A the radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at %0A one place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base for %0A the R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also... %0A  %0A >Depends on the environment %3A  in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in %0A >a dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this %0A >concept. %0A  %0A Nope. FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. That is, unless %0A the two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength. %0A This is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes. %0A Signals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong... %0A  %0A >> What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter? %0A  %0A As high as possible to eliminate outside influence, and also to enhance %0A attenuation of multipath signals.

For example, the latest GPS launcher had the %0A (very prominent) logos on its side of %0A    - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher) %0A    - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite) %0A    - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and %0A    - the GPS/Navstar program office %0A    This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather %0A "public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only %0A organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the %0A side, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting %0A a 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras %0A is "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my %0A opinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has %0A rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...] %0A    There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials %0A for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large %0A advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of %0A several serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at %0A putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload %0A bay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in %0A that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms %0A participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for %0A the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For %0A example, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a %0A Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras %0A would scan past it.) %0A    %0A ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES %0A    The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about %0A 1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed %0A to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe %0A company was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly, %0A Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last %0A Olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from %0A participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for %0A example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the %0A British visiting cosmonaut to Mir. %0A    Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch %0A vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET %0A recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements %0A on the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie "The Last %0A Action Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating %0A organizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the %0A main fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster %0A rockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for %0A one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in %0A Space News magazine a couple of months ago. %0A    (As a side note %3A  Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is %0A talking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he %0A created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising %0A sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the %0A space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on %0A the upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use %0A his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and %0A receiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch %0A is a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the %0A advertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is %0A coming from NASA.) %0A    %0A ORBITAL "BILLBOARDS" %0A    Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for %0A some time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert %0A Heinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several %0A different potential projects have been developed, although none have %0A been implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel %0A II" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in %0A orbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial. %0A                                                 (cont) %0A  %0A --- Maximus 2.01wb %0A

Finally, %0A the 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up,  %0A became warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I %0A took a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride. %0A They had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours %0A before I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom -- %0A surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon. %0A  %0A Today was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes, %0A 50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat %0A Touring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot. %0A Some sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one %0A MSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on %0A the back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that %0A Cycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like %0A a big moto party. %0A  %0A After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime, %0A and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/ %0A pray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the %0A parking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from  %0A the Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else %0A into the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the  %0A ST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of %0A the road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a %0A bicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought. %0A  %0A Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could  %0A think was "big".  Then I put one foot up.  "Heavy" came to mind very %0A quickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to  %0A tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed %0A nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road. %0A  %0A By 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even %0A on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that  %0A did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is %0A on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north %0A of the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95 %0A splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access %0A highway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton,  %0A Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester. %0A On its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about %0A 30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many %0A thoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections. %0A  %0A Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along %0A in top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane  %0A changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this  %0A thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the %0A fairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was %0A non-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless. %0A Smooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of, %0A but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless %0A buzz. %0A  %0A The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the %0A brakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius, %0A decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.   %0A The section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok %0A in this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack %0A oft featured in "Spencer for Hire" -- a place where you could really  %0A find "Spencer", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting %0A through traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128. %0A  %0A About half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal %0A for "hold on tight".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second %0A gear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a  %0A short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light %0A traffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new. %0A Well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort %0A lane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went  %0A until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed %0A there.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering,  %0A I looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring. %0A  %0A Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the "get %0A off in a mile" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted %0A to re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea %3A   there were %0A several manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the  %0A slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could  %0A see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed %0A to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad %0A out front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put %0A the thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side %0A stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute. %0A  %0A  %0A My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable, %0A hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than  %0A list, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is. %0A --  %0A 	 Frank Evan Perdicaro 				Xyvision Color Systems %0A       Legalize guns, drugs and cash...today.		101 Edgewater Drive %0A    inhouse %3A  frank %40 marvin, x5572				Wakefield MA %0A outhouse %3A  frank %40 contex.com, 617-245-4100x5572		018801285 %0A

One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out, %0A not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all %0A of the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach %0A that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the %0A 'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally %0A unreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern %0A sculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal. %0A I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that, %0A just because it has changed the way we strive. %0A  %0A BTW, there are places that people haven't fouled.

Both teams seemed a bit tense in the %0A opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got %0A into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out- %0A standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9 %3A 45 of the first period to record %0A their first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on %0A penalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play  %0A and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had %0A their problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 %0A tries. %0A  %0A The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the %0A blue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the  %0A Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex- %0A pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse %0A in his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to  %0A the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this  %0A morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday. %0A  %0A 1st period %3A   %0A 1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won %0A the draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the %0A puck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the %0A far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He %0A put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up %0A in 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where %0A Sydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the  %0A hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs. %0A  %0A Millen and Fleury went off at 4 %3A 57.  Skrudland went off at 12 %3A 25 but the Kings %0A failed to convert.  Carson went off at 14 %3A 53 and the Flames failed to convert. %0A Dahlquist went off at 18 %3A 34 and Dahl went off at 19 %3A 30, giving the Kings a 30 %0A second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in %0A the period. %0A  %0A 2nd period %3A   %0A The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed %0A to convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into %0A the stands and received a delay of game. %0A  %0A 1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the %0A puck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit  %0A the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated  %0A down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and %0A skated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him  %0A and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander. %0A  %0A 2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play. %0A Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed %0A for the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot  %0A where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson %0A came from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot %0A between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease. %0A  %0A 3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off %0A the puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass %0A cross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot, %0A beating a diving Vernon on the glove side. %0A  %0A 4-1. 2 %3A 59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the %0A near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his %0A own rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low %0A slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon. %0A  %0A Skrudland went off at 10 %3A 53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at %0A 12 %3A 35 and Watters went off at 14 %3A 40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they %0A failed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17 %3A 19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive %0A power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high %0A sticking at 17 %3A 31.  Sandstrom went off at 18 %3A 03 to close out the period.  The %0A Kings hit 3 goal post in the period. %0A  %0A 3rd period %3A  %0A The Kings used the phrase "Initiate, not retaliate" and it was very evident here %0A in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames  %0A continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game. %0A  %0A 5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1 %3A 06 mark.  The Kings shot %0A the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to %0A cut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him, %0A wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the %0A crease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net %0A where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon. %0A  %0A Sydor went off at 1 %3A 24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3 %3A 22 as the teams skated 4 on 4. %0A  %0A 5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net %0A and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the  %0A crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey. %0A  %0A Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury %0A tripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where  %0A Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing  %0A a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6 %3A 08 mark.  Unfortunately, the  %0A Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6 %3A 44) and Watters (at  %0A 8 %3A 19) took penalties.   %0A  %0A 5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8 %3A 47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near  %0A point, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the %0A net, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of %0A Hrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA. %0A  %0A 6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9 %3A 56 and the Kings converted on the power play %0A to seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone  %0A cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed  %0A the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass,  %0A beating Vernon on the ice, stick side. %0A  %0A At the 16 %3A 17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he %0A went after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single %0A minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames %0A right out of the game. %0A  %0A On the plus side %3A   The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey %0A as they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent %0A penalty killing. %0A  %0A On the minus side %3A   The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or %0A the Flames will surely get that power play back on track. %0A  %0A Notes %3A  %0A ------ %0A The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix. %0A  %0A Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point. %0A  %0A The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving %0A the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game. %0A  %0A Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon  %0A games.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play %0A over their last 9 games. %0A  %0A The teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season. %0A  %0A Playoffs %3A  %0A Campbell Conference %3A  %0A Smythe Division %3A  %0A LA  6   %40  CAL 3 		LA leads 1-0 %0A WIN     %40  VAN %0A  %0A Norris Division %3A  %0A STL 4   %40  CHI 3		STL leads 1-0 %0A TOR     %40  DET %0A  %0A Wales Conference %3A  %0A Adams Division %3A  %0A BUF 5   %40  BOS 4 (OT)	BUF leads 1-0 %0A MON 2   %40  QUE 3 (OT)	QUE leads 1-0 %0A  %0A Patrick Division %3A  %0A NJ  3   %40  PIT 6		PIT leads 1-0 %0A NYI 1   %40  WAS 3		WAS leads 1-0 %0A  %0A Records %3A  %0A -------- %0A vs	Smythe	 Norris	 Patrck	Adams	Overall %0A ================================================ %0A Home %3A     0- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    0- 0-0  %0A Road %3A     1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    1- 0-0 %0A ============================================================== %0A Total %3A    1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0	0-0-0	 1- 0-0   %0A  %0A Box Score %3A  %0A ========================= %0A Calgary      0 1 2 - 3 %0A Los Angeles  1 3 2 - 6 %0A ========================= %0A  %0A 1st period %3A   %0A LA  Sydor 1 (Gretzky, Sandstrom), 0 %3A 16 %0A     LA  Millen - high sticking, 4 %3A 57 %0A     CAL Fleury - high sticking, 4 %3A 57 %0A     CAL Skrudland - interference, 12 %3A 25 %0A     LA  Carson - tripping 14 %3A 53 %0A     CAL Dahlquist - holding stick, 18 %3A 34 %0A     CAL Dahl - roughing 19 %3A 30 %0A  %0A 2nd period %3A   %0A     CAL Verson - delay of game (served by Ashton), 1 %3A 34 %0A CAL Suter 1 (Fleury), 2 %3A 48 (sh) %0A LA  Carson 1 (Shuchuk, Sydor), 3 %3A 13 (pp) %0A LA  Huddy 1 (Taylor, Rychel), 3 %3A 37 %0A LA  McSorley 1 (unassisted), 6 %3A 36 %0A     CAL Skrudland - elbowing, 10 %3A 53 %0A     LA  Sydor - tripping, 12 %3A 35 %0A     LA  Watters- hooking, 14 %3A 40 %0A     LA  McSorley - holding, 17 %3A 19 %0A     CAL Suter - high sticking, 17 %3A 31 %0A     LA  Sandstrom - hooking, 18 %3A 03 %0A  %0A 3rd period %3A  %0A LA  Millen 1 (Granato, Donnelly), 1 %3A 06 %0A     LA Sydor - hooking, 1 %3A 24 %0A     CAL Nieuwendyk - tripping, 3 %3A 22 %0A CAL Dahlquist 1 (Otto), 4 %3A 23 %0A     CAL Fleury - major (boarding), game misconduct, 6 %3A 08 %0A     LA  Granato - tripping, 6 %3A 44 %0A     LA  Watters - interference, 8 %3A 19 %0A CAL Yawney 1 (MacInnis, Reichel), 8 %3A 47 %0A     CAL MacInnis - roughing, 9 %3A 56 %0A LA  Carson 2 (Sandstrom, Robitaille), 10 %3A 32 (pp) %0A     LA  Hardy - holding, 11 %3A 38 %0A     CAL Skrudland - slashing, 16 %3A 17 %0A     CAL Stern - double roughing, cross-checking, 10 min. misconduct, 16 %3A 17 %0A  %0A Overtime %3A  none %0A  %0A Shots %3A  %0A ------ %0A Los Angeles   8  9 14 - 31 %0A Calgary       5  8 11 - 24 %0A  %0A Power play conversions %3A  %0A ----------------------- %0A For %3A       2 of 10; for the year %3A   2 of  10,  20.00% %0A Against %3A   0 of  8; for the year %3A   8 of   8, 100.00% %0A  %0A Goalies %3A  %0A -------- %0A Los Angeles - Hrudey (1-0-0) %0A Calgary - Vernon (0-1-0) %0A  %0A Attendance %3A  18,605 %0A  %0A Scratches %3A  %0A ---------- %0A Rob Blake - back contusion %0A Guy Leveque - numbers %0A Lonnie Loach - numbers %0A Marc Potvin - numbers %0A Brandy Semchuk - numbers %0A Robb Stauber - numbers %0A Brent Thompson - numbers %0A Jim Thomson - numbers %0A  %0A Lines - Forwards %3A  %0A ---------------- %0A *Robitaille - Gretzky - Sandstrom  %0A Donnelly - Millen - Kurri %0A Rychel - Conacher - Taylor %0A Granato - Carson - Shuchuk %0A  %0A Lines - Defense %3A  %0A ---------------- %0A *Huddy - Sydor %0A Watters - Zhitnik %0A Hardy - McSorley %0A  %0A * denotes starting lineup %0A  %0A Next game %3A  %0A ---------- %0A Wednesday, April 21  %40  Calgary Flames; 6 %3A 30pm Pacific Time on Prime Ticket %0A =============================================================================== %0A Stan Willis (willis %40 empire.dnet.hac.com) %0A net contact %3A  L.A.

Eklund has never had a point a game season in %0A his career, his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify as %0A a disappointment? If anything he's a surprise. %0A  %0A My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players, %0A but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggest %0A disappointment is Bill Dineen. I thought that he was going to be the perfect %0A coach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHO %0A has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year. Any %0A coach that thinks putting Eric Lindros at the point on power plays is a %0A bright idea needs to go back to coaching school. %0A  %0A pete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner %0A

No offense, Bill, I %0A don't mean to say that you're not being straight, but I wonder how you %0A know about this?  Have you actually every used your secret method to break %0A all the different kinds of bike locks?  Or are you taking someone's word %0A for it? %0A  %0A The fact is, it is unlikely that someone reading anything here is going to %0A go into a successful bike-stealing business because they read anything in %0A rec.motorcycles.  So please tell us what you are talking about.  We can't %0A even protect against an assault, or discuss methods, if you don't come out %0A with it. %0A  %0A See, I have heard the ones about the pipes, and the liquid nitrogen, and the %0A cordless Dremel tools, and a bunch of other ones.  The most plausable method %0A (I am not a bike thief, so I really don't know for certain) is just to put %0A a rod through each wheel, and use four guys to just lift the bike into a %0A truck.  This works because most people don't lock their bikes TO anything. %0A Since that method is so childishly easy, I figure a nice, visible chain or %0A cable locking the bike to something is likely to make a lazy thief go on %0A to the next bike. %0A  %0A (Hey, finally an advantage to the weight and high CG of the Concours!   %3A -) %0A  %0A %7CEspecially since I have a bike that I would hate to see ripped off %0A %7Cby such a trival tactic. WARNING NO lock alone is a safe deterent against theft, %0A %7Cthe thief doesnt need to be a locksmith or a lock-picker to walk away with your %0A %7Cproperty!  I personally think motion alarms in combination to a lock %0A %7Cof this type is the way to go if in fact you are that concerned. %0A  %0A What tactic are you referring to?  If we don't know what you are talking about, %0A we can't very well guard against it, can we? %0A  %0A For my money (literally) I rely on a combination of a motion-detector alarm %0A with pager when I'm out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area, C&C %0A insurance, and I try to park in obvious, visible areas with lots of people %0A about.  (See, if someone just plays with the bike without intention of %0A stealing it, at least some eyes are on it, and if they get too rambunctious, %0A they'll set off the alarm.) %0A  %0A That's for a nice bike.  For a ratbike, the trick is to always keep its %0A actual value well below blue-book, so that it looks so crappy nobody would %0A WANT to steal it, and even if they were stupid enough to, you would make %0A a profit on the deal.   %3A -) %0A  %0A Seriously, if I (for instance) need to go on a business trip for a week, %0A and (sadly) have to leave the bikes sitting, they both get a shitty-looking, %0A but useable cover, locked on, and both bikes locked to each other and a %0A curb bumper in the parking lot under the light.  I usually rig the cable %0A locks I use (aircraft cable) so that if anyone pulls on either bike or %0A the cable joining them, the Concours alarm goes off.  And I have a friend %0A come buy every day to have a look and make sure they're still there.  The %0A only thing I have ever had stolen was a $60 cover, and that was over  %0A winter storage, with the battery out of the bike (and thus no alarm). %0A  %0A Oh, put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through, and %0A place them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off. %0A  %0A That's the best that I can think of.  Most of the locks I see people put %0A on bikes look, well, not too mechanically sound.

Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective %0A point-of-view? %0A  %0A And, as usual, you defend your insults with "he started it."  "Yeah, I %0A took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it."  "So %0A what if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first."  Besides that, I %0A think it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it. %0A So your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of %0A the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway. %0A  %0A Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool %3A   "I %0A never borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you %0A gave it to me."

All Hail the Szabo Plan! %0A  %0A *** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning *** %0A  %0A Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or you %0A would have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason %0A to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations %0A that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more %0A meaning than they ever should have had. %0A  %0A My reading of what Nick actually said is that "people aren't required in %0A all parts of all space processes", so your taking issue with his opinions %0A regarding people in the space program, I read as "People are required in %0A all parts of all space processes."  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'm %0A so patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat %0A your terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and %0A string models that all the computer mags have been raving about  %3A -) %0A  %0A The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'd %0A only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's your %0A job, Fred. %0A  %0A And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points, %0A simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan' %0A that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that %0A you do as much as anyone. %0A  %0A >More deliberate lack of understanding, Tommy? %0A  %0A No, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts made %0A you imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even though %0A it's no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone as %0A dense as myself. %0A  %0A >>>>If you have a problem with Nick's delivery, address that.

Being a little hypocritical, %0A >Tommy (to go with the immaturity)?  Or is this just the pique of a %0A >net.ghod wannabe who got turned down by someone he *thought* was new %0A >(and hence could be 'instructed' -- Tommy, I saw you come on the net). %0A  %0A Who cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you saw %0A me come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years. %0A If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went %0A down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's %0A just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's %0A no worse than your own. %0A  %0A Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical, %0A while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my %0A complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling %0A isn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might %0A see it better, Fred. %0A  %0A "Net.ghod wannabe"?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted my %0A motivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as %0A your insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care about %0A people that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to %0A impress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private %0A mail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a %0A jerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands. %0A Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and %0A bringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable %0A purpose of embarassing me.

If not, how fancy does the compression need to be? %0A  %0A A good vocoder like ours will give you 8000 bits per second locked at %0A full rate (it's a variable rate voice activity vocoder).  If you want %0A less quality, cut that to 4000 bps (half rate).  At full rate variable %0A you could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem.  This %0A requires a DSP or ASICs, though.  An RS-6000 has a CPU that could %0A probably do it in real-time, because it has the add-and-multiply %0A instruction and a few other DSP things. %0A  %0A If you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples a %0A second (for not very good voice) with your 8 bit samples (ISDN is 8000 %0A 8-bit samples a second), which is 32 kbps.  You could do a fast 2 %3A 1 %0A compression on that to get it down to 16 kbps, which is just about %0A V.32bis.  The quality at this point is very bleah, but it should work. %0A Now add in the time for your encryption method.  You're going to need %0A sampling hardware, which is no problem on a new Mac, an Amiga.  Or a %0A PC with a SoundBlaster card (just because they're so popular and cheap %0A - you could also build a simple ADC).  The problem with the %0A SoundBlaster is that it doesn't seem to be full duplex - you can't %0A sample and play backq at the same time, making a two-way conversation %0A a bit tough.  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be %0A required. %0A  %0A The only thing that worries me is that 2 %3A 1 compression - the %0A SoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware, but other than that %0A I don't have a good feel for how processor intensive it is, so I can't %0A estimate how fast a PC you'd need. %0A  %0A  %0A --  %0A Not all men who drink are poets.

Some early zero maintenance  %0A automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure  %0A shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb.

And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable, without %0A demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system.

Alexander Mogilny led the %0A comeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at %0A 3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots %0A on goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and %0A LaFontaine all night. %0A  %0A Roster move %3A  %0A  %0A Andre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy %0A scratch. %0A  %0A Lines %3A  %0A  %0A Eklund-Lindros-Recchi %0A Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen %0A Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy %0A Faust-Acton-Brown %0A  %0A Galley-Bowen %0A Yushkevich-Hawgood %0A Carkner-McGill %0A  %0A Tommy Soderstrom %0A  %0A Game Summary %3A  %0A  %0A Say, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that %0A woman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume! %0A  %0A The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have %0A been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the %0A first period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday %0A when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that %0A he was getting bored back there... %0A  %0A Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After %0A Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards %0A to Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead %0A to Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed %0A the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and %0A in on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his %0A stick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the %0A right past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0 %3A 18. It was so beautiful Eric and %0A Garry should turn down their assists  %3A -). %0A  %0A The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong %0A and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive %0A struggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when %0A Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10 %3A 26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into %0A the boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not %0A a terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got %0A a post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS. %0A  %0A Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13 %3A 31 for taking down Mark Recchi to %0A give the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league %0A didn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a %0A good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards %0A the end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept %0A missing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18 %3A 19 to give %0A the Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the %0A fans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots %0A were 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point. %0A  %0A Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was %0A disappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered %0A a rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the %0A season went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was %0A Russ Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed %0A Snider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do %0A it all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for %0A next year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the %0A end of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup. %0A He expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title %0A the following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based %0A on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer. %0A  %0A He's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it "outstanding"). Happy with %0A the current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux %0A of Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable. %0A Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there %0A was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in %0A four years if there was a consensus. %0A  %0A The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May %0A took a tripping penalty at 0 %3A 51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble %0A getting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving %0A throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres %0A blue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed %0A across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the %0A top of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling %0A through the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the %0A race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2 %3A 15. %0A  %0A Then Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line %0A and went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was %0A all over it. %0A  %0A The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them. %0A Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when %0A Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer %0A took a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4 %3A 22. The Sabres coudln't %0A get started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the %0A FLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and %0A headed the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to %0A make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top %0A of the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5 %3A 40. That was all for Fuhr, John %0A Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over. %0A  %0A But the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to %0A just get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all %0A over them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through %0A Soderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that %0A missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as %0A he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it. %0A Mistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried %0A about A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right %0A next to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and %0A mistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the %0A puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his %0A stick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7 %3A 48, two streaks %0A end for the FLYERS. 150 %3A 28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills. %0A  %0A Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8 %3A 36 with a high sticking %0A minor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get %0A set up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued %0A to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended. %0A Things evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill %0A allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a %0A faceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of %0A him. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and %0A that meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major, %0A 7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14 %3A 15, Barnaby only got 5. %0A  %0A The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long %0A they could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to %0A Ledyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by %0A Soderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of %0A the net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had %0A moved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving %0A at the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net %0A at 17 %3A 34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to %0A put it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break. %0A  %0A The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek %0A was strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the %0A neutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS %0A blue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the %0A left circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at %0A 18 %3A 56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between %0A the 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off %0A angles... %0A  %0A That was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres. %0A  %0A Into the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the %0A FLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in %0A the slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until %0A he had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he %0A hit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time. %0A  %0A Than an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood %0A untouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under %0A Soderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on, %0A horn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange %0A reason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they %0A could be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade %0A that went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria %0A for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net... %0A  %0A Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2 %3A 35. The FLYERS %0A could not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through, %0A but were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck %0A from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across %0A to Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net %0A just inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass, %0A but twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing %0A puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4 %3A 42. 4-3 FLYERS. %0A  %0A But the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive %0A left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate %0A out, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew %0A in, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at %0A 5 %3A 24 to tie the game at 4. %0A  %0A Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5 %3A 55. The FLYERS set up %0A in the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in %0A the middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the %0A line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6 %3A 44. %0A  %0A Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8 %3A 19. %0A The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went %0A after it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated %0A to the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing %0A through the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over %0A the blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8 %3A 39. 3rd hat trick of the season %0A for Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th %0A of the season. %0A  %0A Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9 %3A 02 to kill the rest of the Sabres %0A power play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the %0A chances on the FLYERS resulting power play. %0A  %0A Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to %0A make some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running  %0A out as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres. %0A Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left %0A corner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found %0A Dineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the %0A right of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton %0A chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19 %3A 48 %0A on his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo, %0A and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the %0A game. %0A  %0A So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much %0A in his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night %0A (unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so). %0A The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against %0A with three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals %0A despite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place %0A since the Rangers lose the tie breaker. %0A  %0A A couple misc notes %3A  %0A  %0A Forget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to %0A announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year. %0A  %0A In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award, %0A but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman. %0A  %0A The Times of Trenton has reported that "a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma" %0A has looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no %0A further tests are necessary in the near future. %0A  %0A Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he %0A expected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back, %0A he feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a %0A role scouting if Farwell didn't want him back. %0A  %0A FLYERS team record watch %3A  %0A  %0A Eric Lindros %3A  %0A  %0A 41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points %0A  %0A (rookie records) %0A club record goals %3A 			club record points %3A  %0A Eric Lindros	40 1992-93		Dave Poulin	76 1983-84 %0A Brian Propp	34 1979-80		Brian Propp	75 1979-80 %0A Ron Flockhart	33 1981-82		Eric Lindros	74 1992-93 %0A Dave Poulin	31 1983-84		Ron Flockhart	72 1981-82 %0A Bill Barber	30 1972-73		Pelle Eklund	66 1985-86 %0A  %0A Mark Recchi %3A  %0A  %0A 52 goals, 69 assists, 121 points. %0A  %0A club record goals %3A 			club record points %3A  %0A Reggie Leach	61 1975-76		Mark Recchi	121 1992-93* %0A Tim Kerr	58 1985-86,86-87	Bobby Clarke	119 1975-76 %0A Tim Kerr	54 1983-84,84-85	Bobby Clarke	116 1974-75 %0A Mark Recchi	52 1992-93		Bill Barber	112 1975-76 %0A Rick Macliesh	50 1972-73		Bobby Clarke	104 1972-73 %0A Bill Barber	50 1975-76		Rick Macliesh	100 1972-73 %0A Reggie Leach	50 1979-80 %0A  %0A *More than 80 games. %0A  %0A FLYERS career years %3A  %0A  %0A Player		Points	Best Prior Season %0A Mark Recchi	121	113 (90-91 Penguins) %0A Rod Brind'Amour	84	77 (91-92 FLYERS) %0A Garry Galley	62	38 (84-85 Kings) %0A Brent Fedyk	59	35 (90-91 Red Wings) %0A  %0A That's all for now... %0A  %0A pete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner %0A  %0A

The article starts with "A leader %0A of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned %0A space station said yesterday the job is tough and may %0A be impossible." O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is %0A possible to cut costs that much and still provide for %0A meaningful research "is a real question for me." %0A O'Connor said "everything is fair game," including %0A "dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the %0A aerospace industry, chopping management of the space %0A station program at some NASA facilities around the %0A country, working closely with the Russian space station %0A Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the %0A manned space shuttle fleet." %0A  %0A O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options %0A so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates %0A into three categories based on cost. %0A  %0A The Post says O'Connor described the design derived %0A from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe %0A Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I %0A listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press %0A on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor %0A talked about how the White House wants three options, %0A sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part %0A of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has %0A formed to look at three options [SSF derivative  %40  LaRC, %0A modular buildup with Bus-1  %40  MSFC, and Single Launch %0A Core ["wingless Orbiter"]  %40  JSC. Later, in response to %0A a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say %0A the option based on a SSF redesign was a "moderate" %0A cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not %0A the "high cost" option as Sawyer wrote). %0A  %0A The article goes on to describe the other two options %0A as "one features modules that could gradually be fitted %0A together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The %0A other is a core facility that could be deposited in %0A orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option %0A would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - %0A the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure." %0A  %0A The last sentence in the article contradicts the title %0A & the first paragraph. The sentence reads "He %0A [O'Connor] said a streamlined version of the planned %0A space station Freedom is still possible within the %0A administration's budget guidelines." %0A  %0A

Shearer %0A  %0A I do not think they can use the eavesdropping as evidence at all. However, %0A using the info they gather while listening, they can go searching THE right %0A place and find good, strong evidence, which they can use in court.  %0A  %0A Question  %3A  currently, it is easy to wire-tap, from the technical point of %0A view, at least. Anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listen %0A to communications between a car-telephone and the ground station. The police %0A also, obviously. The clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the %0A non-authorized person to eavesdrop (note that I DO NOT write << impossible>> ). %0A The privacy will thus improve from the current situation. Poeple who REALLY %0A have something to hide already DO NOT use the phone to speak of these things. %0A If an illegal operation is really worth, one can afford having critical data %0A carried by a person rather than sending it electronically.  %0A The clipper chip will not change this.  %0A  %0A The problem is more politic. Foreign countries will never accept the clipper %0A chip is the access to the escrow cannot be directly granted to their own %0A police following their OWN law, not the US law. i.e. each country will have %0A its own escrow. How then will it be possible to monitor the international %0A traffic? or, will encrypted international traffic be possible ? or will there %0A be an international escrow, some kind of U.N. thing ? %0A  %0A Forbidding crypted communication is impractical %3A  how is it possible to spot %0A a crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulate %0A on the various existing networks. What about private networks ? And this will %0A be more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrase %0A in the next years. %0A  %0A I think that the clipper chip can only be an interesting device to limit the %0A risk of , for instance, one's girlfriend's husband listening to his wife's %0A communications. It will bring no more as regards to security. Is it worth ? %0A I think so if its cost is limited, I think that many privacy invasions are done %0A not only by official services, but also by private entities. The clipper can %0A help reducing these. Provided we do not hope too much of it, it is not a real %0A danger and it can be helpful. %0A  %0A Ph. HOOGVORST %0A

The transformer is just that - a  %0A transformer.  It's there primarily to step the voltage up or down.  (Although %0A the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT %0A negligible, as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing to %0A get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a %0A "snubber" diode across it would tell you.  Actually, many transistors intended %0A for switcher use today have the diode built in.) %0A  %0A The basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (in %0A a somewhat simplified manner) %3A   The AC line is rectified to produce a %0A high voltage, more-or-less unregulated DC rail.  The energy storage (or %0A "filter") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor. %0A The transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer, %0A resulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which  %0A are then rectified and filtered.  At least one of the transformer's outputs %0A is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor, %0A which acts in a "pulse-width modulation" (PWM) fashion to control (by varying %0A the pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, and %0A therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary.  The remaining outputs %0A may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-less %0A tracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linear %0A regulation added.  You may also note that the feedback between the  %0A regulated output and the PWM control (which is most typically an IC) %0A is not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to various %0A safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be %0A electrically isolated.  Often, the feedback path involves an optoisolator %0A to meet this requirement. %0A  %0A While the transformer isn't the primary energy-storage device in these %0A designs, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can %0A be ignored; besides the inductive "kick" giving the switch transistor a %0A bad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all the %0A energy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another. %0A In some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others, %0A you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn't %0A saturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the  %0A imagination!  %3A -)). %0A  %0A I'm NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer;  %0A hopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors %0A in the above. %0A  %0A  %0A Bob Myers  KC0EW   Hewlett-Packard Co.      %7COpinions expressed here are not %0A                    Systems Technology Div.  %7Cthose of my employer or any other %0A myers %40 fc.hp.com    Fort Collins, Colorado   %7Csentient life-form on this planet. %0A

Liability issues %0A     are wholly unresolved. %0A    %0A   - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP %0A     software (see the question on cryptography).  %0A  %0A   - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies) %0A     vary between sites. %0A  %0A   - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are %0A     mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time. %0A  %0A _____ %0A <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity? %0A  %0A    %0A   Users %0A   ----- %0A  %0A   - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the %0A     seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others. %0A   - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others. %0A   - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on %0A     Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups. %0A   - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations. %0A     Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases %0A     network traffic. %0A   - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this %0A     is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt' %0A     hierarchy is preferred. %0A   - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e. %0A     references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for %0A     readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any %0A     inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even %0A     future ones under the same handle. %0A   - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your %0A     identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by %0A     sending anonymized mail to yourself. %0A   - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them.  %0A     Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege. %0A   - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity. %0A   - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation. %0A     Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead. %0A   - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large %0A     amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating %0A     his hardware, all for your convenience. %0A  %0A   Operators %0A   --------- %0A  %0A   - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an %0A     introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and %0A     consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and %0A     monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and %0A     security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or %0A     lassaiz-faire? %0A   - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate %0A     potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user %0A     is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user %0A     posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your %0A     users trust you to protect them. %0A   - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations %0A     where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g. %0A     warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke %0A     the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.) %0A   - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware. %0A     Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly %0A     and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with %0A     users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under %0A     ``(in)stability of anonymity''. %0A   - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running? %0A     What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is %0A     your commitment to it? %0A   - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an %0A     address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item.  %0A     Consult a lawyer about your liability. %0A   - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared %0A     to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you %0A     do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system %0A     adminstrator, consult those who do and are. %0A   - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If %0A     possible, query group readers. %0A   - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message %0A     format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure %0A     the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header. %0A   - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from %0A     physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations. %0A  %0A   Readers %0A   ------- %0A    %0A   - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason %0A     that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that %0A     equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail %0A     anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its %0A     volume is heavy or increasing). %0A   - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters %0A     will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate %0A     responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence. %0A   - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy, %0A     harassment, extortion, etc. %0A   - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they %0A     offend you personally. %0A   - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the %0A     idea of anonymity itself. %0A   - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings %0A     should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or %0A     `conceivable' need exists. %0A  %0A   References %0A   ---------- %0A    %0A   See e.g. ftp.eff.org %3A /pub/academic/anonymity %3A  %0A  %0A   > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual %0A   > privacy and the use of handles.

Not perfect and won't %0A   > kill followups.  %0A    %0A   Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask %0A   anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so %0A   far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common %0A   as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering. %0A    %0A _____ %0A <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers? %0A  %0A   Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for %0A   individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is %0A   almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion %0A   and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack %0A   started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was %0A   wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises) %0A   but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided %0A   anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up %0A   the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous %0A   alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through %0A   servers like there's no tomorrow.'' %0A    %0A   Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in %0A   researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste %0A   <Karl_Kleinpaste %40 godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system %0A   from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the %0A   server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge, %0A   and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by %0A   multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended %0A   advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group %0A   support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was %0A   arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.''  %0A   K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an %0A   anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus %0A   against it.  %0A  %0A   K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to %0A   `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and %0A   used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of %0A   intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his %0A   server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to %0A   abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the %0A   facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was %0A   created.'' %0A  %0A   In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf %40 penet.FI) set up the most %0A   controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on %0A   scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized %0A   mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine %0A   the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide %0A   accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests. %0A    %0A   J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet %0A   newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological %0A   opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy). %0A   Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium, %0A   abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than %0A   ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of %0A   anonymity is also controversial. %0A  %0A   For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb %0A   1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate %0A   crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via %0A   anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been %0A   posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then %0A   non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a %0A   New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of %0A   vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating %0A   through many newsgroups.  %0A    %0A   The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded %0A   that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,'' %0A   suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was %0A   not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of %0A   the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived %0A   association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries %0A   for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous %0A   user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his %0A   detractors. %0A  %0A   Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal %0A   opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news %0A   operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire %0A   extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the %0A   scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is %0A   best described as `inundated' %3A  it has registered over 13,000 users %0A   in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a %0A   day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized %0A   through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due %0A   to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to %0A   find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned. %0A  %0A   Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to %0A   dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste %0A   threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate %0A   news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages %0A   originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to %0A   threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several %0A   times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it %0A   by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5 %0A   hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the %0A   service's administration. In response to the serious threats he %0A   disabled global group access temporarily for one week and %0A   encouraged his users to defend the service publicly. %0A    %0A   Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by %0A   ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security %0A   weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is %0A   currently in the process of code development and testing. He is %0A   planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon %0A   to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new %0A   system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple %0A   email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption, %0A   etc. %0A  %0A   A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec. %0A   1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie %40 pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography %0A   in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of %0A   confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public %0A   access account, and he had to shut it down after only several %0A   weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately %0A   originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the %0A   software to the public domain. %0A  %0A   Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on %0A   government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and %0A   group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the %0A   group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers, %0A   and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable %0A   digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in %0A   the mainstream news media.  deltorto %40 aol.com has volunteered to %0A   attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing %0A   easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and %0A   encryption. %0A  %0A   See also sections on ``views on anonymous posting'' below and ``what %0A   is going on with anon.penet.fi?'' in this document. %0A    %0A   (Thanks to Carl Kleinpaste %0A   <Karl_Kleinpaste %40 godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu>, David Clunie %0A   <dclunie %40 pax.tpa.com.au> and Johan Helsingius <julf %40 penet.fi> for %0A   contributions here.) %0A  %0A  %0A _____ %0A <8.5> What is the value of anonymity? %0A  %0A   KONDARED %40 PURCCVM.BITNET %3A  %0A      %0A   > I think anonymous posts do help in focusing our attention on the %0A   > content of one's message.

When I asked, people said that the %0A >interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more %0A >complicated. %0A  %0A You are quite correct in your understanding.  The filtering is not %0A interpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal %0A you are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru an %0A all-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's %0A heart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaks %0A that weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the %0A properly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at %0A that point.  I use a CPU to do all the math.  It takes a decent (but not %0A unreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this.  You can keep up with things %0A in realtime if you write efficient code. %0A  %0A In case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response) %0A filter.  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method.  Anybody out %0A there know the real answer?  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line with %0A resistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  This strikes me as %0A the most cost effective method for volume production runs. %0A  %0A  %0A >Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the "effective" %0A >sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency %0A >antialiasing filters.

So, assuming the quality of %0A >all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should %0A >allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias %0A >filtering. %0A  %0A Actually, I think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that %0A they have a marketting gimic.  I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to %0A filter an oversampled signal than not.  You can use sloppier components and %0A give the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp.   It's too bad that they %0A charge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build. %0A  %0A I seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.  They are %0A built to a price spec, and that spec says "cheap as possible!".  %0A  %0A  %0A >					---Joel Kolstad %0A  %0A   -dave %0A --  %0A Dave McMahan                            mcmahan %40 netcom.com %0A                                         37N 17.382    121W 59.190  %0A

What about guys like %3A  %0A Nieminen, Jutila, Riihijarvi, Varvio, Laukkanen, Makela, Keskinen and (even %0A if he is aging) Ruotsalainen? The main difference between finnish and North- %0A American players is, that our players tend to be better in the larger rink. %0A The Canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in Europe.  %0A And I think that there was more in our success than Ketterer and luck (though %0A they helped).

The name of the company %0A is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end %0A of this message on how to contact them). %0A  %0A    Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that %0A we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications %0A brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers. %0A  %0A    His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the %0A rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are %3A  %0A  %0A  - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use %0A    the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced. %0A  %0A  - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone %0A    devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all. %0A    This stuck them as strange, until now... %0A  %0A  %0A    Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several %0A concerns over the new Clipper Chip %3A  %0A  %0A   - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code. %0A  %0A   - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto %0A     system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency %0A     of the government. %0A  %0A   - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm %0A     is vulnerable over time to an attacker. %0A  %0A   - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that %0A     it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or %0A     changing the keys themselves. %0A  %0A   - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and %0A     money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed %0A     engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very %0A     difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique %0A     to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is %0A     hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip. %0A  %0A Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell %0A me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet. %0A However he told me a little %3A  %0A  %0A  - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been %0A    granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is %0A    secure. %0A  %0A  - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm. %0A    The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret %0A    until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate %0A    the following %3A  %0A  %0A     - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but %0A       Mr. Melnick stated "Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.") %0A  %0A     - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES. %0A  %0A     - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA). %0A  %0A     - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that %0A       it is _adujustable_ and is "More than adequate for security." %0A  %0A     - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and %0A       can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which %0A       is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I %0A       consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use. %0A  %0A     - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques %0A       such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the %0A       hardware chip. %0A  %0A     - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars %0A       for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced %0A       enough, which probably won't happen]). %0A  %0A     - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm %0A       and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted %0A       data into "blocks." This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know %0A       what the block header is. This program operates at all supported %0A       RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm. %0A  %0A     - Most importantly %3A  IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!! %0A  %0A  %0A  %0A Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out %0A of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in %0A stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact %0A them, they can be reached at.. %0A  %0A Secure Communications Technology %0A 8700 Georgia Ave. Suite 302 %0A Silver Spring, MD %0A  %0A (301) 588-2200 %0A  %0A I talked to Mr. Bryen who represents the company.

For example, is %0A  %3A  >there a constant sensation of falling?  %0A  %0A Ron Baalke (baalke %40 kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) replied %3A  %0A  %3A  Yes, weightlessness does feel like falling.  It may feel strange at first, %0A  %3A  but the body does adjust.  The feeling is not too different from that %0A  %3A  of sky diving. %0A  %0A I'm no astronaut, but I've flown in the KC-135 several times.  I'll %0A tell you about my first flight. %0A  %0A At the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine %0A straightened.  I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab %0A onto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor) %0A to prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my %0A involuntary motions.  My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could %0A feel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while %0A you have a cold). %0A  %0A At that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response, %0A since I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experiment %0A going and keeping track of all the parts during the "return" of %0A gravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really pay %0A attention to physiology at that time. %0A  %0A After about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one %0A of the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motion %0A sickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly %0A -- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid, %0A concious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out to %0A parabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I %0A had to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically %0A useless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in %0A the back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just %0A this purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill. %0A (He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous %0A people who don't get sick on the thing.) %0A  %0A I didn't think of it as a "constant sensation of falling" so %0A much as like swimming in air.  It's very close to the sensations %0A I feel when I'm scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up. %0A  %0A Jerry %3A  %0A  %3A  >And what is the motion sickness %0A  %3A  >that some astronauts occasionally experience?  %0A  %0A Ron %3A  %0A  %3A  It is the body's reaction to a strange environment.  It appears to be %0A  %3A  induced partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress. %0A  %3A  Some people are more prone to it than others, like some people are more %0A  %3A  prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than others.  The mental %0A  %3A  part is usually induced by a lack of clear indication of which way is %0A  %3A  up or down, ie %3A  the Shuttle is normally oriented with its cargo bay %0A  %3A  pointed towards Earth, so the Earth (or ground) is "above" the head of %0A  %3A  the astronauts.  About 50% of the astronauts experience some form of %0A  %3A  motion sickness, and NASA has done numerous tests in space to try to %0A  %3A  see how to keep the number of occurances down. %0A  %0A I'm a volunteer in JSC's Space Biomedical Laboratory where they do, %0A among other things, some of the tests Ron mentions.  I was in one %0A called the Pre-flight Adaptation Trainer, which consisted of a chair on %0A a several-degree-of-freedom motion base with moving geometric visual %0A aids.  The goal was to measure the victim's^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H subject's %0A responses and subjective physiological descriptions and see if repeated %0A exposure to this environment could reduce future motion sickness %0A symptoms. %0A  %0A Jerry -- %0A  %0A I don't know of any former or active-duty astronauts who personally %0A read this group.  I know that Bruce McCandless's office had been %0A waiting anxiously for the Space Station Redesign option I posted %0A last week, but I don't think Bruce reads the group himself. %0A  %0A -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office %0A       kjenks %40 gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368 %0A  %0A      "The man who makes no mistakes does not usually make %0A       anything." %0A         -- Edward John Phelps, American Diplomat/Lawyer (1825-1895) %0A

How many such machines will fit into Fort Meade? %0A  %0A > I think PGP2.3 should have 256 bit IDEA keys... %0A  %0A Thousands?  Tens of thousands?  Do some arithmetic, please...  Skipjack %0A has 2^80 possible keys.  Let's assume a brute-force engine like that %0A hypothesized for DES %3A   1 microsecond per trial, 1 million chips.  That's %0A 10^12 trials per second, or about 38,000 years for 2^80 trials.  Well, %0A maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond, and build %0A a machine with 10 million chips.  Sure -- only 3.8 years for each solution. %0A  %0A IDEA uses 128-bit keys.  Shall I bother doing the calculations for you? %0A Hint %3A   multiply 3.8 years by 2^(128-80).  And you can't do IDEA at that %0A speed; key setup takes much too long.  I wouldn't be surprised if that %0A were the case for Skipjack, too, though there's no way of knowing just %0A yet.  DES used only xor because that's what was feasible with mid-70's %0A technology.  Modern chips can do a lot more. %0A  %0A NSA may or may not know how to crack Skipjack and IDEA (I doubt it for %0A the former; I have no idea for the latter, though it does seem to be a %0A strong cryptosystem).  But it ain't gonna be by exhaustive search. %0A

We have been using our processes since way before Challenger.  Challenger %0A    in and of it self did not uncover flaws. %0A  %0A 2. What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is %0A    not dependent on "sophisticated tools"  (CASE tools?).  However, tools %0A    cannot fix a bad process.  Also, tool support for HAL/S (the Shuttle %0A    Language) is somewhat limited. %0A  %0A 3. The Onboard Flight Software project was rated "Level 5" by a NASA team. %0A    This group generates 20-40 KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA. %0A  %0A 4.

Sci., Urbana, IL %0A Date %3A  Fri, 16 Apr 1993 21 %3A 01 %3A 10 GMT %0A Lines %3A  107 %0A  %0A [An article from comp.org.eff.news, EFFector Online 5.06 - Carl] %0A  %0A                        April 16, 1993 %0A  %0A       INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY   %0A                            PROPOSAL %0A  %0A        The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement  %0A on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of  %0A millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a  %0A comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues  %0A such as export controls which have effectively denied most people  %0A easy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues  %0A posed by new technology. %0A  %0A        However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has  %0A already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before  %0A any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the  %0A Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone  %0A equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed  %0A by the National Security Agency. The so-called "Clipper Chip" is an  %0A 80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into  %0A chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow  %0A agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over  %0A law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The  %0A encryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be  %0A available to any manufacturer for incorporation into their  %0A communications products. %0A  %0A        This proposal raises a number of serious concerns . %0A  %0A        First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution  %0A before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may  %0A not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may  %0A have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the  %0A government as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, %0A independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets  %0A based on open standards. %0A  %0A        Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested.  %0A Yet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm  %0A classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public  %0A and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a  %0A standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.   %0A  %0A        Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed  %0A system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and  %0A law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored  %0A publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the  %0A safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive  %0A individual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal  %0A inquiries?   %0A  %0A        In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the  %0A importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into  %0A digital privacy and security.  However, the "Clipper chip" solution  %0A ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before  %0A the discussion even begins. %0A  %0A DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL %3A  %0A  %0A ESCROW %0A  %0A The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of  %0A whom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid  %0A warrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts  %0A over to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General  %0A will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the  %0A Administration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal  %0A agency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental  %0A organization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents  %0A yet. %0A  %0A Key registration would be done by the manufacturer of the  %0A communications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person  %0A using it. %0A  %0A CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS %0A  %0A The Administration claims that there are no back door means by  %0A which the government or others could break the code without  %0A securing keys from the escrow agents and that the President will  %0A be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order  %0A to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for  %0A an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security  %0A arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results  %0A of the investigation would then be made public. %0A  %0A GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER %0A  %0A In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government  %0A believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big  %0A customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service,  %0A VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President.  %0A  %0A FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT %3A  %0A  %0A Jerry Berman, Executive Director %0A Daniel J.

Space based colonies and factories %0A that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna %0A has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital %0A sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers %0A a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink, %0A and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and %0A heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity %0A wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them. %0A  %0A We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually %0A ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to %0A deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more %0A expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the %0A easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few %0A centuries, if not much longer. %0A  %0A Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio %0A astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site %0A of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for %0A defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is %0A unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. %0A The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good %0A enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for %0A conventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a %0A bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little %0A ultimate profit either. %0A  %0A Gary %0A --  %0A Gary Coffman KE4ZV          %7C    You make it,     %7C gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary %0A Destructive Testing Systems %7C    we break it.     %7C uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary %0A 534 Shannon Way             %7C    Guaranteed!      %7C emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary  %0A Lawrenceville, GA 30244     %7C                     %7C  %0A

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire %0A celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2) %0A swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities. %0A  %0A 2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked %0A to the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity %0A from April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay %0A Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to %0A 11 days as a part of this sequence memory load. %0A  %0A 3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss %0A timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase. %0A  %0A 4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the %0A Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer %0A (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received %0A properly. %0A  %0A 5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify %0A the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment %0A data; long term trend analysis is continuing. %0A  %0A 6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the %0A optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary %0A analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation %0A index is near the optimal level. %0A  %0A 7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the %0A Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument. %0A Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly. %0A  %0A 8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster %0A flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed %0A during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal. %0A  %0A 9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant %0A changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads %0A 19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These %0A measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special %0A anomaly team. %0A  %0A 10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows %3A  %0A  %0A        a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts %0A        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin %0A        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner %0A        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees %0A            off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading) %0A        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1 %0A        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within %0A            acceptable range %0A        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range %0A        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS, %0A            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS %0A        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within %0A            acceptable range %0A        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours %0A            Time To Initiation - 260 hours %0A  %0A  %0A GDS (Ground Data Systems) %3A  %0A  %0A 1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test %0A for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21 %0A (Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify %0A the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller %0A (TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement %0A for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry %0A rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry %0A Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The %0A 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was %0A not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS %0A data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of %0A the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993. %0A  %0A  %0A TRAJECTORY %0A  %0A      As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory %0A status was as follows %3A  %0A  %0A 	Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU) %0A 	Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU) %0A 	Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour %0A 	Distance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km %0A 	Round Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds %0A  %0A  %0A SPECIAL TOPIC %0A  %0A 1.

Rather than use technology to accommodate %0A the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and %0A law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against %0A industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement. %0A  %0A Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to %0A protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to %0A protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption %0A technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the %0A unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used %0A by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals. %0A  %0A A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" has %0A been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a %0A new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new, %0A relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to %0A an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications %0A using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in %0A commercial use today. %0A  %0A This new technology will help companies protect proprietary %0A information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations %0A and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted %0A electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the %0A ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to %0A intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.  %0A  %0A A "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the %0A "Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding %0A Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique %0A  %0A  %0A                                 2 %0A  %0A  %0A "keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government %0A agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the %0A device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately %0A in two "key-escrow" data bases that will be established by the %0A Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to %0A government officials with legal authorization to conduct a %0A wiretap. %0A  %0A The "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no %0A new authorities to access the content of the private %0A conversations of Americans. %0A  %0A To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the %0A Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new %0A devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the %0A government will be offered access to the confidential details of %0A the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report %0A their findings. %0A  %0A The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of %0A encryption's dual-edge sword %3A   encryption helps to protect the %0A privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield %0A criminals and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and other %0A approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access %0A to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it %0A to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology %0A trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system), %0A the President has directed government agencies to develop a %0A comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates %3A  %0A  %0A      --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to %0A           employ voice or data encryption for business purposes; %0A  %0A      --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone %0A           calls and data, under proper court or other legal %0A           order, when necessary to protect our citizens; %0A  %0A      --   the effective and timely use of the most modern %0A           technology to build the National Information %0A           Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and %0A           the competitiveness of American industry in the global %0A           marketplace; and  %0A  %0A      --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export %0A           high technology products. %0A  %0A The President has directed early and frequent consultations with %0A affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the %0A privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed. %0A  %0A  %0A  %0A                                 3 %0A  %0A The Administration is committed to working with the private %0A sector to spur the development of a National Information %0A Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer %0A technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to %0A information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks %0A ("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV %0A programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone %0A system transmits voice. %0A  %0A Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important %0A role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act %0A quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding %0A its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that %0A protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting %0A them from those who break the law. %0A  %0A Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.  %0A The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new %0A encryption technology are also available.   %0A  %0A For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of %0A Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758. %0A  %0A --------------------------------- %0A  %0A  %0A QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S %0A TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE %0A  %0A  %0A  %0A  %0A Q %3A    Does this approach expand the authority of government %0A      agencies to listen in on phone conversations? %0A  %0A A %3A    No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with %0A      no new authorities to access the content of the private %0A      conversations of Americans. %0A  %0A Q %3A    Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on %0A      a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation %0A      encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to %0A      decipher the message? %0A  %0A A %3A    They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a %0A      court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They %0A      would then present documentation of this authorization to %0A      the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and %0A      obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug %0A      smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are %0A      stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key %0A      escrow system. %0A  %0A Q %3A    Who will run the key-escrow data banks? %0A  %0A A %3A    The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent %0A      entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the %0A      Administration have yet to determine which agencies will %0A      oversee the key-escrow data banks. %0A  %0A Q %3A    How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure %0A      how strong the security is?   %0A  %0A A %3A    This system is more secure than many other voice encryption %0A      systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will %0A      remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow %0A      system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of %0A      cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all %0A      potential users that there are no unrecognized %0A      vulnerabilities. %0A  %0A Q %3A    Whose decision was it to propose this product? %0A  %0A A %3A    The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the %0A      Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in %0A      this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the %0A      President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet %0A      officials. %0A  %0A Q %3A    Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry? %0A  %0A A %3A    We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on %0A      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify %0A      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have %0A      briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the %0A      decisions related to this initiative. %0A  %0A Q %3A    Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers? %0A  %0A A %3A    The government designed and developed the key access %0A      encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the %0A      microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product %0A      manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip %0A      manufacturer that produces them. %0A  %0A Q %3A    Who provides the "Clipper Chip"? %0A  %0A A %3A    Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance, %0A      California, and will sell the chip to encryption device %0A      manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed %0A      to other vendors in the future. %0A  %0A Q %3A    How do I buy one of these encryption devices?  %0A  %0A A %3A    We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating %0A      the "Clipper Chip" into their devices. %0A       %0A Q %3A    If the Administration were unable to find a technological %0A      solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be %0A      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more %0A      powerful encryption devices? %0A  %0A A %3A    This is a fundamental policy question which will be %0A      considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow %0A      mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product %0A      that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive %0A      than others readily available today, but it is just one %0A      piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to %0A      encryption technology, which the Administration is %0A      developing. %0A  %0A      The Administration is not saying, "since encryption %0A      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement, %0A      we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have %0A      effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every %0A      American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an %0A      unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a %0A      false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is %0A      an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be, %0A      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned, %0A      balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper %0A      Chip" and similar encryption techniques. %0A  %0A Q %3A    What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton %0A      Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from %0A      that of the Bush Administration?   %0A  %0A A %3A    It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption %0A      technology in telecommunications and computing and are %0A      committed to working with industry and public-interest %0A      groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' %0A      privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law %0A      enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime %0A      and terrorism. %0A  %0A Q %3A    Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use %0A      the government hardware? %0A  %0A A %3A    Voice encryption devices are subject to export control %0A      requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is %0A      required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The %0A      same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the %0A      attractions of this technology is the protection it can give %0A      to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this %0A      in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a %0A      case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these %0A      devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan %0A      to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability %0A      of these products. %0A  %0A ----------- End included article -----------  %0A  %0A --  %0A pat %40 rwing.uucp      [Without prejudice UCC 1-207]     (Pat Myrto) Seattle, WA %0A          If all else fails, try %3A        ...!uunet!pilchuck!rwing!pat %0A WISDOM %3A  "Only two things are infinite; the universe and human stupidity, %0A          and I am not sure about the former."              - Albert Einstien %0A

This proposal to establish a secret government designed %0A cryptography chip with government key registration as the standard for voice %0A encryption is very disturbing. The idea that citizens must register their  %0A secrets with the government just in case they are trying to keep them secret  %0A is patently unAmerican. Additionally, the press release for this program %0A strongly implied that other forms of cryptography would be banned after the  %0A Clipper Chip standard is in place. This latest attack on our civil rights is  %0A deeply disturbing and is frankly a voting issue for me.  %0A  %0A The presidents press release stated that the plan strikes a balance between the %0A legitimate needs of law enforcement and a citizens right to privacy but this  %0A is not the case. The fact is that since other strong cryptographic equipment  %0A is avalible the criminals, drug dealers and terrorists mentioned in the press  %0A release will simply use non clipper cryptography. Meanwhile the average citizen %0A may gain no protection against warentless wiretaps by the government since the  %0A government escrowed key is derived deterministicly from the unit serial number %0A which is broadcast by the chip durring its opperation. This seems like an  %0A obvious back door for the NSA and law enforcement. If you still do nott  %0A understand my objection to key registration, consider the way J. Edgar Hoover  %0A blackmailed government officials like yourself; would you now use a phone to  %0A transmit personal details of your life that the NSA and FBI have the keys to? %0A  %0A  %0A ______________________________________________________________________________ %0A Well heres a letter, I didnt spell check it since I dont know how in EMACS %0A so you might want to do that.  %0A  %0A Bill Smythe %0A

Let's do it right this %0A time!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want %3A  %0A  %0A [1] microgravity/vacuum process research %0A [2] life sciences research (adaptation to space) %0A [3] spacecraft maintenence  %0A  %0A The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to %0A centralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet %0A their targets by a wide margin %3A  the military and commercial users  %0A took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to  %0A tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization %0A and miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these %0A two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement %0A in commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial  %0A users have come up with a superior strategy for space development %3A  the  %0A constellation.   %0A  %0A Firstly, different functions are broken down into different  %0A constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function %3A  %0A thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits, %0A comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task %0A is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation, %0A providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed. %0A  %0A SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments %0A and are also prime candidates for constellization. %0A  %0A [1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now %3A  %0A COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for %0A short-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is %0A inexpensive, incremental improvement %3A  installation of U.S. facilities  %0A on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab %0A to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET. %0A We might also expand the research program to take advantage of  %0A interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt  %0A or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can %0A be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a  %0A station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO. %0A  %0A [2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity, %0A but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation %0A environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter %0A of LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since %0A astronauts will have little practical use in the space program %0A until costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using %0A astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation, %0A and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation %0A tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity %0A in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the %0A radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars, %0A Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support %0A machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR %0A interface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown, %0A follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface, %0A testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions %0A are spent on astronauts. %0A  %0A [3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in  %0A Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated %0A robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can %0A practice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck %0A solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs, %0A inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be %0A spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat %0A companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards. %0A  %0A By applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting %0A rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we %0A have radically improved the capability of the program while %0A greatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag, %0A we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study %0A life's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety  %0A of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum %0A research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose %0A orbits. %0A  %0A N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration %0A as well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.   %0A Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously  %0A we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used %0A to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and %0A sample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can %0A be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology %0A greenhouses on Mars at low cost. %0A  %0A  %0A --  %0A Nick Szabo					 szabo %40 techboook.com %0A

I personally am concerned only with a small lab   %0A with ten PC's and ten Mac's.  (I'm not the manager, but help him with   %0A admin often).  IMHO, copy-protection schemes of ANY sort are nothing more   %0A than a major headache for the legitimate user.  Anyone who wants a copy of   %0A your program and doesn't care about legality will get a copy.  Period.    %0A "Pirate board" or no pirate board.  I too have "friends" who blatantly and   %0A quite successfuly "hack" copy protection schemes practically in their   %0A sleep. %0A  %0A Let's consider what goes on in our lab.  Almost daily we have at least one   %0A machine down, sometimes several, due to some goofball screwing up some   %0A setting or other on a piece of software.  Admittedly, we (being students,   %0A mostly) are not the world's most efficient and effective network   %0A administrators, but we try.  Keeping even the twenty machines that are   %0A (partly) my responsibility even vaguely looking and "acting" similar to   %0A the average user, and maintaining "behind-the-scenes" consistency is a   %0A real headache, but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty   %0A different folder locations of Norton Utilities when some guy trashes his   %0A disk. %0A  %0A Often we have hardware problems at peak "business" times and have to do   %0A some parts-swapping to get stuff working temporarily. . . . %0A  %0A Well, I'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all . . .. %0A  %0A The point is, often we have to re-install software and copy configuration   %0A files etc. from machine to machine.  By far the easiest way we have found   %0A to do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to, then   %0A COPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine (of that   %0A machine's type).  This ensures us that (for at least ten minutes) we have   %0A ten IDENTICAL machines to work with.  Having them networked simplifies   %0A this considerably, as our major packages (WordPerfect, Windows, etc.) are   %0A all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with. %0A  %0A Often, however, we need to install a package requested by some instructor   %0A to one, some, or all of the machines for a special project.  This is   %0A usually a hand-written or shareware,etc. program similar to what I believe   %0A the original poster was asking about.  The few we have had with "copy   %0A protection" schemes have caused nothing but NIGHTMARES for us to maintain   %0A  . . %0A  %0A In short, don't waste your time with a copy protection scheme.  It's sort   %0A of like outlawing guns.  The criminals will get your program anyway, and   %0A you will only be hurting the legitimate, honest user.  Write a good user's   %0A guide and tech manual, whatever else for your program (PLEASE do this   %0A REGARDLESS of whether you copy protect the thing!!!), and only distribute   %0A the manual to LICENSED users.  Jack the price to cut your losses, but   %0A please take a cue from the major companies (who can admittedly afford the   %0A costs of illegal copies far better than you) and don't burden the   %0A legitimate user with a "copy protection" scheme! %0A  %0A  %0A Sorry for the tirade, but it's been a long day here . . ..  %3A -) %0A  %0A  %0A Mark S.

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has  %0A 36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain %0A throughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention %3A  Nick Kypreos and %0A Mark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than %0A MVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on %0A the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess %0A I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value. %0A  %0A Biggest surprise %3A  Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season %0A as a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+ %0A points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming %0A from the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention %3A  Andrew %0A Cassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and %0A Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23 %0A and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the %0A role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake %0A bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put %0A up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started %0A performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing,  %0A although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the %0A right side. %0A  %0A Biggest disappointment %3A  Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77 %0A point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started %0A the season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate, %0A since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it). %0A Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded %0A the powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his %0A way out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left %0A to run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the  %0A Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention %3A  Steve Konroyd, also subpar %0A after signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of %0A competence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better %0A hockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only %0A seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got %0A to make a number of starts in a row. %0A  %0A -SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder) %0A -steveg %40 cadkey.com %0A

It's not fully %0A up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different %0A manufacturer's synonyms) %3A  %0A  %0A ------ %0A In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view %0A of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my %0A views on things like availability and backward compatibility) %3A  %0A  %0A 74	The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively %0A 	obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball %0A 	functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families. %0A  %0A 74H	Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher %0A 	power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F. %0A  %0A 74L	Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed. %0A 	Very obsolete; use CMOS. %0A  %0A 74S	Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in %0A 	power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F. %0A  %0A 74LS	Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower %0A 	power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of %0A 	devices. %0A  %0A 74F	Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high %0A 	speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good. %0A  %0A 74AS	Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things %0A 	that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful. %0A  %0A 74ALS	Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly %0A 	new, availability and prices possibly a problem. %0A  %0A 74C	Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with %0A 	4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer %0A 	CMOS 74 families. %0A  %0A 4000	(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS %0A 	family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low %0A 	power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast. %0A 	Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity, %0A 	but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too). %0A 	There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The %0A 	clear choice when speed is not important. %0A  %0A 74HC	A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power %0A 	consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for %0A 	general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability. %0A 	CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of %0A 	supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power %0A 	consumption at faster speeds. %0A  %0A 74HCT	74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read %0A 	the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility %0A 	in CMOS involves some compromises. %0A  %0A 10K	(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources %0A 	claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for %0A 	serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though %3A   read and follow %0A 	the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited, %0A 	can be expensive. %0A  %0A 100K	(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and %0A 	inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however. %0A  %0A As for compatibility between families %3A   the 74 families (except 74C and %0A 74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices %0A you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just %0A have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible %0A with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of %0A hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using. %0A 10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle. %0A  %0A Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are %0A interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet. %0A --  %0A All work is one man's work.             %7C Henry Spencer  %40  U of Toronto Zoology %0A                     - Kipling           %7C  henry %40 zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry %0A

The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer %0A in one of eight zones across the stage.

A friend of mine worked for an %0A electronics manufacturer on with a west-coast office. They routinely sold %0A equipment to the Japanese. One day, the Japanese started showing up with %0A discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the %0A products. %0A  %0A This company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field  %0A offices. The Japanese had simply intercepted it. So my friend, the computer %0A systems admin, came up with a solution. He started sending the data out %0A double-block-encrypted with DES.  %0A  %0A Two days after this new distribution plan was implemented, the president of %0A the company got a visit from a pair of government agents. They told him to %0A "knock it off". The president gave in, since his company did a considerable %0A business with the federal government. %0A  %0A Now, if the government wasn't monitoring the communications, how would they %0A even know that the encryption system was installed? Further, since encryp- %0A tion isn't illegal, and DES certainly isn't, what is the basis of the %0A government's cease-and-desist demand? %0A  %0A The spooks do whatever they think is necessary, with or without the blessings %0A of the law.

Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals. %0A Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good %0A goaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the %0A stretch to preserve the Blues lead. %0A  %0A The Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and %0A taking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty %0A on Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the %0A blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired %0A a long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After %0A the goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks %0A 10-9 in the first period. %0A  %0A Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3 %3A 12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on %0A the left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour %0A came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown %0A collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal. %0A  %0A Two minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a %0A short-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy %0A Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass %0A across the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5 %3A 30 for the 2-1 lead. %0A  %0A Noonan completed his hat trick 3 %3A 11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1. %0A Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat %0A Stephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan %0A deflected the puck in the net. %0A  %0A Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12 %3A 49 after picking up the %0A rebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for %0A the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards %0A to Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues %0A outshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period. %0A  %0A With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9 %3A 56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked %0A up a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith %0A was called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1 %3A 07. %0A  %0A The Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into %0A the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot, %0A and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and %0A passed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp %0A angle. %0A  %0A Just 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson %0A Emerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with %0A two Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the %0A slot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3. %0A  %0A The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph %0A made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy %0A Murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2 %3A 30 left in the game. %0A The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the %0A puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held %0A on to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period, %0A totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent %0A in the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on %0A on four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in %0A the league.

The other x %0A three instruments are focusing instruments, that, more or less, form %0A an image, so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the  %0A resolving power of the optics.  BATSE is an altogether different %0A beast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of  %0A the craft.  Positional information is triangulated from the  %0A differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors. %0A Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors %0A and errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors have %0A any independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used to %0A determine parallax.  Indeed, parallax would just add a very small  %0A component to the positional error.   %0A  %0A Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would  %0A require resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort  %0A cloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together  %0A now %3A  "Parallax ARc SECond", a parsec is the distance of an object  %0A that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line). %0A If the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we're going to  %0A have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline. %0A  %0A The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and %0A watches the entire sky simultaneously, a realy handy combination %0A when you have no idea where the next burst is coming from. %0A  %0A -Kevin %0A

I believe I discussed countersteering a horse %0A before. %0A  %0A Basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and %0A neck-rein.  Plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and %0A you pull in the direction you wish to go.  Neck-reining steers a horse %0A by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the %0A horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  When training a %0A plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins %0A under his necks.  Thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein %0A pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit %0A (which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days). %0A  %0A Are you sorry you asked yet? %0A  %0A --- %0A Ed Green, former Ninjaite %7CI was drinking last night with a biker, %0A   Ed.Green %40 East.Sun.COM   %7Cand I showed him a picture of you.

Some of what I  %0A would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  %0A never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  %0A unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  %0A as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  %0A a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  %0A - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  %0A Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   %0A Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  %0A and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  %0A in an afterlife.   %0A  %0A The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  %0A and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  %0A crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  %0A is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  %0A the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  %0A thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   %0A But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.  %0A  %0A Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  %0A in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  %0A currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  %0A impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  %0A that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  %0A into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  %0A forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  %0A (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  %0A one weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  %0A malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  %0A the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  %0A miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters  %0A much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  %0A high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.  %0A  %0A But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't  %0A fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever -  %0A like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch  %0A commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,  %0A truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   %0A If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  %0A least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last %0A beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.   %0A  %0A To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage  %0A of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at  %0A 8 %3A 25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the  %0A local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it  %0A if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  %0A be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  %0A while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that  %0A as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,  %0A even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.  %0A  %0A Regards,  %0A Wm. Hathaway  %0A Baltimore MD  %0A

The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points, %0A not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say. %0A The non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish. %0A  %0A I personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames. %0A The first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat. %0A This has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which I %0A contend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  While it is true that %0A the flame I posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends, %0A dinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate %0A flair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actually %0A that it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and %0A boring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....) %0A  %0A The other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has %0A a few weaknesses as well.  In the first place, it can get verbose and  %0A tedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly %0A identify with one side or the other.  In the second, discussing someone's %0A personal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous. %0A (Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leads %0A to a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING. %0A Finally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can't haul my %0A big dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which %0A actually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter %0A to my use and flamage in general. %0A  %0A In summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  While it may %0A be the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily %0A weaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor %0A applicable.  You also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a %0A flatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and I'll bet you and your  %0A motorcycle lean to the outside while turning.

This %0A summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300 %0A participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in %0A Seville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by %0A the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for %0A the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI). %0A  %0A OLYMPUS has been particularly useful  %3A  %0A -      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of %0A        new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small %0A        antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested %0A        data transmission, videoconferencing, business television, %0A        distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few %0A        examples. %0A  %0A -      in opening the door to new telecommunications services %0A        which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower- %0A        frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over %0A        Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band. %0A  %0A -      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS %0A        received for the first time in Europe, over several months, %0A        high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and %0A        then distributed it to various centres in Europe. %0A  %0A When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the %0A world's largest telecommunications satellite; and no other %0A satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four %0A different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands. %0A  %0A OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some %0A of the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite is %0A given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or %0A services; over the past four years some 200 companies and %0A organisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over %0A 100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning %0A organisation. %0A  %0A  %0A  %0A As the new technologies and services tested by these %0A OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then %0A make use of operational satellites such as those of %0A EUTELSAT. %0A  %0A OLYMPUS utilisation will continue through 1993 and 1994, %0A when the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches the %0A end of its design life. %0A  %0A         %0A

My point is that your implied position about the "Waco %0A Massacre" is an assertion cum political position. According to a CNN poll, %0A about 86% of Americans think the FBI acted properly, and a majority think %0A they should have done it (the tear gas) a lot sooner. A large majority also %0A believe the FBI was not at all responsible for the death of the victims, %0A Koresh was. (Let's avoid the kind of fruitless argument of the sort If A %0A hadn't X'd, then B might not have Y'd....) %0A  %0A What you call the "Big Brother Chip" is right now a proposal under %0A discussion, and it is not yet clear that strong crypto is going to be %0A banned. %0A  %0A Therefore neither justifies "any tactic is fair." Thus the statement is %0A nonsense. It is pernicious, because "any tactic" can lead to damaging %0A others. %0A  %0A As I see you know from the tone of your reply, there's nothing personal %0A intended. %0A  %0A David %0A --  %0A David Sternlight         Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of %0A                          our information, errors and omissions excepted.   %0A  %0A  %0A

In general, you %0A should expect to finish the game with some bruises. However, %0A there is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain %0A and discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another %0A player. Felix Potvin, IMO, crossed that line on Wednesday. That %0A two hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot of %0A respect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity. He %0A did not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the %0A slot area (a legal position for Dino to be in). Instead, he %0A slashed in an attempt to injure. It was out of shear frustration. As a %0A Leaf supporter (just a supporter, I'm not a Leaf fan really), I %0A was very disappointed. %0A  %0A You're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at least %0A in his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times and %0A for that reason, many fans (and players) disliked them (that's %0A why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about %0A these issues). Let's hope that Felix doesn't do that again. I'd %0A hate to see anyone (even Dino --- although I admit I don't like %0A him very much) get seriously hurt from such careless (but %0A intentional) use of the stick. %0A  %0A Gary %0A  %0A  %0A

I played %0A Elvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made %0A a very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is %0A roughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time %0A fighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games, %0A especially Elvira II %3A  Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to %0A stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This  %0A is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is %0A quite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found %0A that is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting %0A strategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is  %0A no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain %0A moderately challanging puzzles. %0A  %0A The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really  %0A broken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits %0A you must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported %0A with no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps %0A you inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must  %0A escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit %0A traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines %0A and pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant %0A zombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue %0A some humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill %0A the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is %0A perhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into %0A Jack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper %0A victim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must %0A avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and  %0A meet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit %0A pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to  %0A stop the almost indestructible zombies.   %0A  %0A Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a  %0A creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though %0A gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game. %0A I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.    %0A  %0A ********************************************************* %0A  %0A - All prices include shipping. %0A - All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated. %0A - US buyers only please. %0A - All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured, %0A   priority USPS. %0A - All games include all original materials including box, manual, %0A   disks, and registration unless otherwise noted. %0A  %0A The first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to %0A get the game.

It's a letter from Jerry %0A Berman to David Chaum from November of 1985, in response to %0A information that Mr. Chaum sent to Mr. Berman. %0A  %0A While I have to congratulate EFF for its prompt response to the %0A Clipper Chip announcement from the White House, I think it's important %0A to recognize the philosophy of their Executive Director, as explained %0A below. %0A  %0A I agree that legal remedies are important, but when pressed, I'd %0A prefer to retain the ability to use purely technical solutions to %0A preserve my privacy, because they'll hold up under fire. %0A  %0A Mr. Chaum has consented to the publication of this letter on the Net.  %0A  %0A I don't work for, nor am I a member of EFF, ACLU, or any similar %0A organizations, but I do agree with them on a great many things.  %0A  %0A 					--Aristophanes %0A  %0A ---------- %0A  %0A  %0A                      AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION %0A  %0A  %0A                        WASHINGTON OFFICE         %0A                                                                 %0A                                                     122 Maryland Avenue, NE %0A  November 1, 1985                                   Washington, DC 20002 %0A                                                     -------------------- %0A                                                     National Headquarters %0A Mr. David Chaum                                     132 West 43rd Street     %0A Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science         New York.

A %0A society of  individuals  and  organizations  that  would  expend  the %0A time and resources to use a  series  of  'digital  pseudonyms' to %0A avoid data linkage does not in my opinion make big brother %0A obsolete but  acts  on  the  assumption  that  big  brother  is  ever %0A present.  I  view  your  system  as  a  form  of  societal  paranoia. %0A  %0A 	As a matter of  principle,  we  are  working  to  enact  formal %0A legal protections for  individual  privacy  rather  than  relying  on %0A technical solutions.   We want to  assume  a  society  of  law  which %0A respects legal limits rather than  a  society  that  will  disobey  the %0A law, requiring  citizens  to  depend  on  technical  solutions.  e.g. %0A require  a  judical  warrant  for  government  interception  of  data %0A communications rather than  encrypt  all  messages  on  the  assumption %0A that regardless of the lawt  the  government  will  abuse  its  power %0A and invade privacy. %0A  %0A 	As a  matter  of  practicality,  I  do  not  think  your  system %0A offers much hope for privacy.    First, the trend toward universal %0A identifiers  is  as  much.-a  movement  generated  by  government  or %0A industry's desire to keep track of all citizens as it is by %0A citizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions. %0A At best,  your  system  would  benefit  the  sophisticated  and  most %0A would opt for  simplicity.  The  poor  and  the  undereducated  would %0A never use or benefit from it. %0A  %0A 	Finally where there's a  will, there's  a  way. If  government %0A wants to link data bases, it  will,  by  law, require  the  disclosure %0A of various individual pseudonyms used by citizens or prohibit it %0A for data bases which the government wants to link.      Since %0A corporations  make  money  by  trading  commercial  lists  with   one %0A another, they will never adopt  the  system  or  if  it  is  adopted, %0A will use "fine printn  contracts  to  permit  selling  various   codes %0A used by their customers to other firms. %0A  %0A 	The solution remains law, policy, and consensus about limits %0A on government or corporate intrusion into areas of individual %0A autonomy.  Technique can be used to enforce that consensus or to %0A override it. It cannot be used as a substitute for such %0A consensus. %0A  %0A  %0A  %0A                                             Sincerely Yours, %0A  %0A                                              /Sig/ %0A  %0A                                             Jerry J.

If you are uninterested, since I will %0A have the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can %0A kill them. %0A  %0A I will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course, %0A are subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as %0A possible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks %0A and/or did not play for another NHL team this season. %0A  %0A Thus, then, let's go to the goaltenders... %0A  %0A #1	BRIAN HAYWARD		Season %3A 	11th %0A Acquired %3A 	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft %0A Grade %3A 		P (D) %0A  %0A It is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that %0A featured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and %0A '89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing %0A grade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this %0A year, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would %0A not be any more than the 3rd-string goalie. %0A  %0A But Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first %0A ever victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames. %0A As he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was. %0A  %0A #30	JEFF HACKETT		Season %3A  3rd %0A Acquired %3A 	'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft %0A Grade %3A 		C %0A  %0A Hackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply %0A wasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles, %0A almost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save %0A percentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to %0A bench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry %0A the team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early %0A injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor, %0A but upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next %0A year. %0A  %0A #31	WADE FLAHERTY		Season %3A  1st (still eligible as rookie) %0A Acquired %3A 	'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent %0A Grade %3A 		I (A-) %0A  %0A It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the %0A incomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary %0A Flames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started %0A the season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades' %0A owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP %0A honors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he %0A tries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs %0A Irbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up %0A all-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can %0A share the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor %0A Robins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he %0A may not ever. %0A  %0A #32	ARTURS IRBE		Season %3A 	1st %0A Acquired %3A 	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft %0A Grade %3A 		B+ %0A  %0A I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that %0A he's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has %0A provided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting %0A the team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26. %0A He has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and %0A making passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the %0A goonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do %0A with such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for %0A a playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named %0A as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts. %0A  %0A =============================================================================== %0A GO CALGARY FLAMES!

The net is a place for open ended %0A     discussion. %0A  %0A     2) I have an idea which would improve space flight? %0A  %0A     Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been %0A     thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for %0A     evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day. %0A  %0A     3) Miscellanous queries. %0A  %0A     These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of %0A     FAQ postings. %0A  %0A  %0A     SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE %0A  %0A     Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet. %0A     Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?] %0A     Edit "Subject %3A " lines, especially if you're taking a tangent. %0A     Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth %0A 	100 posts). %0A     Internet mail readers %3A  send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST %0A 	not SPACE. %0A     Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all %0A 	references.) %0A     Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're %0A 	responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize! %0A     Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail %0A 	or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the %0A 	'reply' function of mailers will work. %0A     Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone %0A 	will get on TV anyway. %0A     Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping %3A  %0A 	keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals %0A 	(use carriage returns). %0A  %0A  %0A     INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS %0A  %0A     I've attempted to break the postings up into related areas.

You are correct, it is illegal to send cryptographic %0A code (and lots of other things) out of the country without a license. %0A HOWEVER, every US citizen has a general export license, allowing %0A export of lots of things, including constitutionally protected speech. %0A This has the effect that it is legal for US citizens to export some %0A things which it is illegal for a US corporation to export without %0A first obtaining a license. %0A  %0A    > Dunno if you'd get one for the particular code you have; the only %0A    > way to find out is to apply for a license. %0A  %0A    Nope, talk to a good lawyer in the area of export law.

Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages %0A on Clipper. %0A  %0A The name of the encryption algorithm is "Skipjack." %0A  %0A Martin Hellman had written %0A  %0A                 and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part %0A                 message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK %0A                 producing %0A  %0A                      E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK} %0A  %0A To which I responded %3A  %0A  %0A         My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the %0A         "family key") and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by %0A         law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this? %0A  %0A I was correct in that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK.  However, Skipjack %0A being a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key %0A for the family key SK. %0A  %0A         The unit key, also called the "chip key," is generated from the %0A         serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks %0A         derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys. %0A         Compute the 64-bit block %0A  %0A                 R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] %0A  %0A         (Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with %0A         two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3. %0A         (I'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that %0A         they're called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are %0A         concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and %0A         the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded. %0A  %0A The seeds S1 and S2 do not change.   The whole process is performed on %0A a laptop computer, and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people %0A so that no one person knows both.  The same S1 and S2 are used during %0A an entire "programming session" to generate keys for a stream of serial %0A numbers.  Everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be %0A thrown out if desired). %0A  %0A The serial number is 30 bits and the values N1, N2, and N3 are formed %0A by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding %0A for each value). %0A  %0A The resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired %0A up with their serial number.  Each pair is stored in a separate file.  The %0A floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two %0A escrow agencies. %0A  %0A Dorothy Denning %0A denning %40 cs.georgetown.edu %0A  %0A -------------------------------------------------------- %0A I am sure more technical detail will be known when time goes by. %0A Please remark, that in posting this, I do not automatically agree %0A with it's contents and implications.

The garage is Unheated.   %0A They were left in their places that they needed to be.  One in the riding %0A lawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle.  The battery in the  %0A riding lawnmower was about 3-4 years old, and one of the cycle batteries  %0A was new, and one was around 5 years old.  Upon spring time, I discovered %0A that all of the batteries were dead, and needed to be recharged.  They all %0A worked properly, except for the older ones, and they had to be replaced  %0A about halfway through the summer.  (they had originally been stored %0A in the garage, and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring) %0A   Last year, I decided to bring them in to the basement, which has two parts. %0A one is dirt and brick, and the other is concrete.  I brought in all three, and %0A discovered in the spring, (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteries %0A dead, but when I put the charger on them, the charger said "HMMMMMMMM" and  %0A the amp-meter read around 1,000,000,000  (In other words, it was pinned) %0A the internal circut tripped, and I went on to the other batteries.  They %0A were the same.   %0A    Realizing that we still had 2 GIGANTIC sailboat batteries, also lead %0A acid, I decided to put the charger on them.  (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years, on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they only %0A needed a small charge, around 2 hours or so on trickle.  I tested them %0A by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts, and they %0A worked fine for around 25 of 'em.  %0A   This leads me to believe one of several things. %0A      1) I bought really #$%tty batteries last year. (sorta true) %0A      2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the %0A         batteries. %0A      3) There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the  %0A           room where the concrete is,  %0A      4) The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air %0A          better than concrete. %0A  %0A (BTW, I can almost waterski in the dirt room)   %0A  %0A    Any other ideas? %0A     *could be the aliens, anything is possible.* %0A   %0A

Well, I was dead %0A wrong.  Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, has %0A informed me that dust grains _aren't_ good radiators in the far IR, %0A which is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field %0A from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin. %0A Sorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled.  Obviously, time for me to %0A take another ISM class  %3A -( %0A  %0A   In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave %0A a talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a brief %0A overview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of %0A about 8 %3A 1, mass ratio about 15 %3A 1 or so, plus lots more...) and then %0A gave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is  %0A that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer %0A solar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind; %0A over time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got %0A scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter %0A and Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially %0A Uranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune - %0A we call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller, %0A already-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through %0A Neptune's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!]. %0A  %0A   He notes that the two recently discovered "Kuiper Belt" objects, %0A 1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same  %0A mass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the %0A larger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks, %0A formed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material %0A into a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to %0A ideas about the formation of Earth's moon.  There is good evidence %0A from spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different %0A (Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn't), which can be used as evidence %0A for the impact theory. %0A  %0A   He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects %0A remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune's  %0A orbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members %0A of this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies %0A will be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane  %0A frost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons %0A by now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think) %0A is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate, %0A and when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms %0A bright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going %0A to be very hard to see. %0A  %0A   I hope I haven't made any errors in the transcription; if you see %0A a howling mistake, it's undoubtedly mine, not his. %0A  %0A   By the way, he's one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby %0A mission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a %0A Titan 4 to send the probe on "just about a rectilinear trajectory" %0A to Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He'd like %0A to use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs %0A MUCH less.  His figures %3A  $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there %0A will be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million %0A for 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally %0A offered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced %0A to increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the %0A marketplace. %0A  %0A   I'm just telling you what he said. %0A  %0A                           Michael %0A  %0A --  %0A -----                                                    Michael Richmond %0A "This is the heart that broke my finger."    richmond %40 astro.princeton.edu %0A  %0A

It would be a strong incentive, as Vesselin points out, for more %0A police agencies to "go rogue" and try to get keys through more efficient %0A (but less Constitutional) means.  Notice what the release said %3A  %0A  %0A    Q %3A    Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on %0A         a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation %0A         encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to %0A         decipher the message? %0A  %0A    A %3A    They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a %0A                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^ %0A         court order, to do the wiretap in the first place. %0A         ^^^^^^^^^^^ %0A  %0A The clear implication is that there are "legal" authorizations other %0A than a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who  %0A knows what's in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  There %0A may well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in which %0A keys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellent %0A position to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  They %0A already have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  There %0A are a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens' rights to access %0A police communications (or use the information they get).  It may be %0A very difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such %0A evidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law. %0A  %0A Throw in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutional %0A restrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who've "retired" from intelligence %0A agencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material. %0A  %0A Don't think it'll happen?   %0A  %0A Well, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professional %0A organization, which for years kept "Red Files" on thousands of suspected  %0A commies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards %0A of evidence were just about zero %3A  people were in the file because they %0A happened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People's Friendship %0A rally was happening -- the police went around writing down license %0A plate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the  %0A meeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive. %0A (They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any %0A more such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes %0A as well.) %0A  %0A Even with well-meaning cops (and I'm sure there are many), there will  %0A be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don't need %0A to assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest  %0A of enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.   %0A Compromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them)  %0A will be a moral dilemma. %0A  %0A Clipper will make criminals out of cops.

Basically to turn left, you to a quick wiggle %0A of the bike to the right first, causing a counteracting lean to %0A occur to the left.  It is a lot more difficult to do on a motorcycle %0A than a bicycle though, because of the extra weight.  (Ok, so my %0A motorcycle is heavy.  Maybe yous isn't.) %0A  %0A -David %0A

In %0A     general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three %0A     categories %3A  Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent %0A     between these networks, and other resources available on one of these %0A     networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to %0A     special 'servers'. %0A  %0A     The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of %0A     several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them. %0A  %0A     One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central %0A     distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In %0A     addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for %0A     Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more %0A     specialized mailing lists described below. %0A  %0A     A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin %0A     board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews %0A     separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a %0A     'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are %0A     called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro', %0A     and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called %0A     'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends %0A     it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby %0A     machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so %0A     that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet %0A     sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was %0A     posted. %0A  %0A     Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and %0A     BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not %0A     accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more %0A     flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make %0A     it the preferred option. %0A  %0A MAILING LISTS %0A  %0A     SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the %0A     International Space University (in only its second change of management %0A     in over a decade). Email space-request %40 isu.isunet.edu (message body %0A     should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note %0A     that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of %0A     a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are %0A     available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve %0A 	julius.cs.qub.ac.uk %3A pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README %0A     for further details. %0A  %0A     Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle %0A     Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line %0A     elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources %0A     as they are released. Email to elements-request %40 telesoft.com to join. %0A  %0A     GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning %0A     System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to %0A     gps-request %40 esseye.si.com to join. %0A  %0A     Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in %0A     space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac %40 cs.cmu.edu) to join. %0A  %0A     Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics; %0A     discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid %0A     capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to %0A     space-tech-request %40 cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and %0A     selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from %0A     gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech, %0A     or by email to space-tech-request if you don't have FTP access. %0A  %0A     SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and %0A     Development of Space and other interested parties. Email %0A     LISTSERV %40 TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying "SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your %0A     name". Email saying "INDEX SEDS-L" to list the archive contents. %0A  %0A     SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status %0A     reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in %0A     Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email %0A     LISTSERV %40 TAMVM1.BITNET saying "SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name" to join. %0A     Email saying "INDEX SEDSNEWS" to list the archive contents. %0A  %0A     Ron Baalke (baalke %40 kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which %0A     carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him %0A     to join the list. %0A  %0A     As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a %0A     mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate %0A     'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list %0A     address rather than the request address. %0A  %0A PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION %0A  %0A     In addition to this FAQ list, a broad variety of topical information is %0A     posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group %0A     sci.space.news created for this purpose).

RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the %0A  four security facilities provided by PEM %3A  disclosure protection %0A  (optional), originator authenticity, message integrity measures, and %0A  non-repudiation of origin (always).  (See %3A  "What is PEM?") %0A  %0A  RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr %40 scss3.cl.msu.edu>. %0A  Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines, %0A  which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc. %0A  %0A  The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5; the current version of the %0A  Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7. %0A  %0A 2)  How can I get RIPEM? %0A  %0A  RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is %0A  considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution %0A  to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or %0A  Canada without an export license.  No such license has been obtained %0A  (nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were %0A  shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something %0A  weaker than DES.  There are some suggestions that this situation may %0A  change now that Clinton is in office.)  The author requests in the %0A  README file that this law not be violated %3A  %0A  %0A  #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution %0A  #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me, %0A  #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM. %0A  %0A  Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is %0A  included with the distribution.  You should read it before using %0A  RIPEM. %0A  %0A  RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent %0A  residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README %0A  file for info.  Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a %0A  product of RSA Data Security, Incorporated; they merely are helping %0A  distribute it. %0A  %0A  RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its "home site" on %0A  ripem.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the %0A  U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out %0A  how to obtain access, FTP there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file %0A  GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are %0A  available here in addition to the full source tree. %0A  %0A 3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine? %0A  %0A  Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of %0A  Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to %0A  Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice %0A  Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports %0A  are expected, and help of users is invited. %0A  %0A 4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer? %0A  %0A  Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend %0A  on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users %0A  guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM %0A  with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH. %0A  Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU %0A  Emacs. %0A  %0A  If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one %0A  in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure, %0A  and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem. %0A  %0A 5)  What is RSA? %0A  %0A  RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means %0A  that there are two different, related keys %3A  one to encrypt and one to %0A  decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other, %0A  you may publish your encryption, or public, key widely and keep your %0A  decryption, or private, key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public %0A  key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to %0A  decrypt it.  Note that the "message" sent with RSA is normally just %0A  the DES key to the real plaintext. (See "What is DES?") %0A  %0A  Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection.  For %0A  originator authenticity, message integrity, and non-repudiation of %0A  origin services to be implemented, the fingerprint of the message %0A  (See "What is a fingerprint, like MD5?") is encrypted with the %0A  sender's private key.  The recipient, or a dispute-resolving %0A  authority, can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm %0A  that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered. %0A  %0A  RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who %0A  invented it.  To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography %0A  in general, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/.  Some information %0A  also may be in sci.crypt. %0A  %0A 6)  What is DES? %0A  %0A  DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or %0A  secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to %0A  encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA. %0A  %0A  RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts %0A  your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the %0A  recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter, %0A  allowing the recipient to recover the DES key. %0A  %0A  DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a %0A  key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it %0A  should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large %0A  corporation or government agency.  It is not likely that the PEM %0A  standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the %0A  near future, because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be %0A  stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with %0A  interoperability. %0A  %0A 7)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5? %0A  %0A  MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc. %0A  It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash, %0A  of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not %0A  possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a %0A  different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus, %0A  instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key, %0A  only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication. %0A  %0A  MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication; for example, %0A  RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file, so %0A  parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate %0A  channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy. %0A  %0A  MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often %0A  used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a %0A  passphrase interpreter or cookie generator. %0A  %0A  MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in %0A  RFC 1321. %0A  %0A  There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong %0A  a hash as was originally believed; presumably some other hash %0A  function will be used if this is accepted as true. %0A  %0A 8)  What is PEM? %0A  %0A  PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a standard for allowing transfer of %0A  encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a %0A  working group of experts.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these %0A  documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115. %0A  %0A  RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM %0A  specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not %0A  handle at this time.  Their addition is planned. %0A  %0A 9)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys? %0A  %0A  For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know %0A  your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message %0A  received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important %0A  that this information be accurate; if a "bad guy" convinces her that %0A  his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read. %0A  %0A  RIPEM allows for three methods of key management %3A  a central server, %0A  the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are %0A  described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution. %0A  None of them provide perfect security.  The PEM standard calls for %0A  key management by certificates; the addition of this feature to RIPEM %0A  is planned, but chicken-egg issues still exist. %0A  %0A 10)  Isn't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM? %0A  %0A  This issue has been considered in the standards process.  RFC 1310, %0A  the specification for Internet standards, has a discussion (section %0A  6) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be %0A  met for a patented method to be included in a standard.  RFC 1421 %0A  addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key %0A  cryptography. %0A  %0A  This does not, of course, mean that all questions are settled or that %0A  everyone is in agreement.  An interesting exchange on the use of %0A  patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key %0A  cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive %0A  (available via FTP %3A  ftp.uu.net %3A /doc/lpf) in the files bidzos.letter %0A  and bidzos.response.  (Amusingly, the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are %0A  compressed with a patented algorithm.) %0A  %0A 11)  What about RSADSI/PKP? %0A  %0A  RSA Data Security, Inc. (RSADSI) is a California-based company %0A  specializing in cryptographic technologies.  Public Key Partners is a %0A  firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S. %0A  patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents %3A  %0A  %0A       Cryptographic Apparatus and Method %0A       ("Diffie-Hellman")...............................

No. 4,424,414 %0A  %0A  PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key %0A  cryptography.  The two businesses are rather closely related (for %0A  example, the same person, Jim Bidzos, is president of both of them.) %0A  PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of %0A  companies (IBM, DEC, Motorola, AT&T, Lotus...) for use in their %0A  products.  PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their %0A  patents. %0A  %0A  RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than %0A  its use of the RSAREF library, and for no reason other than its %0A  author's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography. %0A  However, after the ball started rolling, people at RSADSI got %0A  interested.  RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site, and some %0A  people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing %0A  code.  RIPEM even won the "Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992" %0A  award. %0A  %0A 12)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar? %0A  %0A  RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography %0A  Standards) identifier describing various characteristics about the %0A  key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as %0A  those of lots of other people's keys.  This does not mean your keys %0A  are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were %0A  generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc. %0A  %0A 13)  What is PGP? %0A  %0A  PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy. %0A  PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently. %0A  PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA. %0A  %0A  A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM %3A  %0A  %0A  - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without %0A    a direct network connection. %0A  %0A  - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability %0A    of working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be %0A    compatible with anything other than itself. %0A  %0A  - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which %0A    comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.  PGP uses its own %0A    implementation of RSA.  PKP claims that it is a violation of its %0A    patents to "make, use or sell" PGP in the U.S. or Canada without %0A    either a license or written permission.  (See %3A  "DISCLAIMER") %0A    (See %3A  "What about RSADSI/PKP?")  Phil Zimmermann, the author of %0A    PGP, stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal %0A    action; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged, but %0A    it hasn't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening %0A    in the future.  He acknowledges in the PGP User's Guide %3A  %0A  %0A    #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,  %0A    #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public %0A    #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is %0A    #contraband. %0A  %0A  - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside %0A    the U.S. and Canada without an export license.  However, PGP %0A    already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places. %0A  %0A  Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is %0A  recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues. %0A  Unfortunately, it's not distributed separately from the program, %0A  which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to %0A  liability concerns. %0A  %0A 14)  What about RPEM? %0A  %0A  RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM, %0A  but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in %0A  an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems.  It was %0A  written by Mark Riordan, who later wrote RIPEM. %0A  %0A  Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many %0A  (including Rabin), PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough %0A  to cover the cipher employed.  This claim is not universally %0A  accepted, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons. %0A  %0A  RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP. %0A  %0A 15)  What is MIME? %0A  %0A  MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is %0A  described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup %0A  comp.mail.mime; a FAQ exists on it.  How PEM should interact with %0A  MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution %0A  of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM %0A  messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft %0A  Internet documents exist on the matter. %0A  %0A 16)  What is TIS/PEM? %0A  %0A  Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy %0A  Enhanced Mail for general availability.  Last I heard, it was %0A  rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent (MH) %0A  rather than a stand-alone system, and in beta test.  I don't know %0A  much more than that. %0A  %0A 17)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM... %0A  %0A  You may wish to check the companion post "ripem-attacks" which %0A  discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM's security and %0A  what procedures will minimize the risk.  RIPEM's main "weak area" is %0A  probably key distribution. %0A

Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke %0A a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from %0A mounting any serious attack. %0A  %0A Injuries %3A  %0A  %0A Pelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh. %0A  %0A Roster Moves %3A  %0A  %0A Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS %0A second pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years %0A old, 6'4", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals, %0A 12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in %0A this game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him %0A up front as well. %0A  %0A Andre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period %0A of the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win, %0A and played again for Hershey Sunday night. %0A  %0A Lines %3A  %0A  %0A Fedyk-Lindros-Recchi %0A Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen %0A Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy %0A Acton-Brown %0A  %0A Galley-McGill %0A Yushkevich-Cronin %0A Carkner-Hawgood %0A Bowen %0A  %0A Tommy Soderstrom in goal. %0A  %0A Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period. %0A  %0A Game Summary %3A  %0A  %0A If the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this %0A year. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after %0A scoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do. %0A  %0A Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal. %0A He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead %0A of taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side. %0A A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a %0A goal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play. %0A  %0A Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when %0A he hooked Doug Gilmour at 4 %3A 25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing %0A unit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The %0A Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept %0A away every rebound. %0A  %0A After the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour %0A gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the %0A net. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef %0A Beranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to %0A get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into %0A the slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for %0A a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8 %3A 10. %0A  %0A The FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS %0A from building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and %0A defense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies %0A were strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners. %0A Then Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had %0A a chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into %0A him, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno %0A was a little far from the boards, and Mike "Mister" McGeough felt that it %0A warranted a boarding call at 15 %3A 38 %0A  %0A The Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were %0A very aggressive (for a change) on the kill. %0A  %0A With time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone %0A and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in %0A a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass %0A to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark %0A checked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and %0A went right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside %0A the blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own %0A goalie at 19 %3A 55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period. %0A  %0A The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk %0A tripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the %0A FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric %0A gloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We %0A could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove %0A and the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was %0A running out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal %0A mouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where %0A Recchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle, %0A and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7 %3A 55. With the assist, Recchi moves past %0A Bobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at %0A 117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points. %0A  %0A Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8 %3A 30 to give the FLYERS another chance on %0A the power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with %0A a slash at 9 %3A 19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most %0A of the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers %0A flared a little at 13 %3A 14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton %0A got a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a %0A hooking minor at 13 %3A 46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's %0A stick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell. %0A Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich. %0A Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski %0A tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point, %0A and just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as %0A nobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net, %0A but Soderstrom stoned him. %0A  %0A The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't %0A get anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS. %0A  %0A The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they %0A decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a %0A little. %0A  %0A The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the %0A period, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making %0A road kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros  %0A (unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing) %0A all at 7 %3A 02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7 %3A 51 on Gilmour. %0A  %0A Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play. %0A  %0A At about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left %0A circle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and %0A as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards %0A it (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the %0A other). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12 %3A 24 to give the %0A Leafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom %0A stoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through %0A Soderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept %0A away by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was %0A equal and preserved the shutout. %0A  %0A Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl %0A at 16 %3A 01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski %0A Baumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17 %3A 02 Rouse and Beranek %0A expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to %0A set up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS %0A zone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran %0A his stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all. %0A 5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches. %0A Upward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got %0A a couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O! %0A Penalties %3A  Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski %0A and Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17 %3A 49. %0A  %0A So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest %0A in stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until %0A Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and %0A blasted it past Puppa at 18 %3A 39. %0A  %0A That was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa %0A did, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the %0A 3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star %0A break. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in %0A the NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't %0A remember that he's tied with. %0A  %0A Next up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot %0A be eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night %0A in Washington would be the official end. %0A  %0A FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points %0A in 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6 %0A games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better %0A than 5 under in 80). %0A  %0A Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th %0A is 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to %0A lose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS %0A will win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie %0A breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble %0A down the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and %0A finish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the %0A goal for the team to focus on. %0A  %0A FLYERS team record watch %3A  %0A  %0A Eric Lindros %3A  %0A  %0A 38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points %0A  %0A (rookie records) %0A club record goals %3A 			club record points %3A  %0A Eric Lindros	38 1992-93		Dave Poulin	76 1983-84 %0A Brian Propp	34 1979-80		Brian Propp	75 1979-80 %0A Ron Flockhart	33 1981-82		Ron Flockhart	72 1981-82 %0A Dave Poulin	31 1983-84		Eric Lindros	67 1992-93 %0A Bill Barber	30 1972-73		Pelle Eklund	66 1985-86 %0A  %0A Mark Recchi %3A  %0A  %0A 51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points. %0A  %0A club record goals %3A 			club record points %3A  %0A Reggie Leach	61 1975-76		Bobby Clarke	119 1975-76 %0A Tim Kerr	58 1985-86,86-87	Mark Recchi	117 1992-93 %0A Tim Kerr	54 1983-84,84-85	Bobby Clarke	116 1974-75 %0A Mark Recchi	51 1992-93		Bill Barber	112 1975-76 %0A Rick Macliesh	50 1972-73		Bobby Clarke	104 1972-73 %0A Bill Barber	50 1975-76		Rick Macliesh	100 1972-73 %0A Reggie Leach	50 1979-80 %0A  %0A FLYERS career years %3A  %0A  %0A Player		Points	Best Prior Season %0A Mark Recchi	117	113 (90-91 Penguins) %0A Rod Brind'Amour	79	77 (91-92 FLYERS) %0A Garry Galley	58	38 (84-85 Kings) %0A Brent Fedyk	58	35 (90-91 Red Wings) %0A  %0A That's all for now... %0A  %0A pete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner %0A  %0A

They like this enough that they are dropping the so %0A called "Digital Telephony" proposal, according to rumours.

The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald %0A  was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy %0A  to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed %0A  on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest %0A  periods I've seen Sweden play this year. %0A  Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many %0A  times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial %0A  save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal %0A  from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way %0A  to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a %0A  nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4 %0A  just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of %0A  the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole.  %0A  Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled %0A  through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes, %0A  Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close %0A  range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away, %0A  and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom. %0A  %0A  Switzerland %3A  %0A  %0A  Goaltender %3A   20 Reto Pavoni  (28 Renatio Tosio) %0A  Defense %3A      26 Rick Tschumi, 2 Martin Steinegger %0A               16 Sven Leuenberger, 5 Martin Rauch %0A                7 Sandro Bertaggia, 17 Patrick Sutter %0A               31 Samuel Balmer %0A  Forwards %3A     22 Alfred Luthi, 11 Felix Hollenstein, 25 Roman Waeger %0A               23 Gil Montandon, 12 Roberto Triulzi, 10 Patrick Howald %0A               35 Christian Weber, 18 Andreas Ton, 24 Joerg Eberle %0A               15 Bruno Erni, 13 Thomas Vrabec, 29 Manuele Celio %0A   %0A - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - %0A  %0A  RUSSIA - CANADA  1-3 (0-2,1-1,0-0) %0A  %0A  1st %3A  CAN 0-1 Kevin Dineen 1     (Garry Galley)                       4 %3A 28 %0A       CAN 0-2 Paul Kariya 2      (Eric Lindros)                      12 %3A 20 (pp) %0A  2nd %3A  CAN 0-3 Eric Lindros 10    (Paul Kariya,Shayne Corson)          9 %3A 40 %0A       RUS 1-3 Valeri Karpov 2    (?)                                 16 %3A 24 %0A  3rd %3A  %0A  %0A  Penalties %3A  RUS 2*2min 1*5min, CAN 5*2min %0A  Referee %3A  Anton Danko, Czech republic %0A  Attendance %3A  8,600 %0A  %0A  Russia probably made their best game of the tourney, but yet there wasn't %0A  enough to win against the effective Canadians. %0A  %0A  Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just %0A  deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play %0A  goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the %0A  far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov. %0A  Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of %0A  the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score. %0A  Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya %0A  entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman, %0A  then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to %0A  deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck. %0A  The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side %0A  and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner. %0A   %0A  Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri %0A  Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and %0A  in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes, %0A  and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros %0A  after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period. %0A  %0A  Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game, %0A  7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player %0A  (among those Kariya with 1+6).

EDT %0A  %0A      THE PRESIDENT %3A   Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's %0A an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the %0A winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the %0A Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell %0A that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win %0A a national championship.  And we're glad to have them here. %0A  %0A      I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to %0A win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to %0A cheer them onto victory. %0A  %0A      Coming from a state that is also relatively small in %0A size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can %0A understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears. %0A In our state people are still talking about the time we won the %0A Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was %0A back in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine %0A will as proud of this team as they are today. %0A  %0A      You know, in my state football is a slightly more %0A popular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.) %0A But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I %0A can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came %0A here.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does %0A have one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish %0A we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.) %0A  %0A      In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In %0A the United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority %0A Leader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior %0A Senator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm %0A actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger %0A than me. %0A  %0A      On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done %0A a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship %0A game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I %0A know a little bit about. %0A  %0A      Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams %0A and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and %0A Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine %0A must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a %0A team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from %0A behind. %0A  %0A      I think it's important, as I ask young people from %0A around America who have achieved outstanding things in working %0A together, to come here to the White House to be recognized and %0A appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values %0A and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all %0A of our lives. %0A  %0A      We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have %0A them here today.  (Applause.) %0A  %0A      (The President is presented with team jersey.) %0A (Applause.) %0A  %0A      THE PRESIDENT %3A   That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful. %0A (Applause.) %0A  %0A      (The President is presented with an autographed stick.) %0A  %0A      THE PRESIDENT %3A   Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.) %0A  %0A                              * * * * * * %0A  %0A      Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco %0A this morning, sir? %0A  %0A      THE PRESIDENT %3A   I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney %0A General made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions %0A to her and to the FBI. %0A  %0A      Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it %0A should be executed? %0A  %0A      THE PRESIDENT %3A   No, they made the tactical decisions. %0A That was their judgment, the FBI. %0A  %0A      Q  Is this a raid? %0A  %0A      THE PRESIDENT %3A   And I will -- I want to refer you to -- %0A talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be %0A done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical %0A decisions. %0A  %0A      Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this %0A morning? %0A  %0A      Q  Any chance for that stimulus package? %0A  %0A      THE PRESIDENT %3A   Senator Mitchell ought to pay my %0A quarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter). %0A  %0A      SENATOR MITCHELL %3A   You have to pay that quarter. %0A  %0A      THE PRESIDENT %3A   I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator %0A Mitchell, he's worth a quarter any day. %0A  %0A      Q  Any chance for your bill, sir? %0A  %0A      THE PRESIDENT %3A   We talked about what was going to happen %0A this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to %0A have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to %0A talk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and %0A talk some more. %0A  %0A      Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your %0A compromise is no compromise. %0A  %0A      THE PRESIDENT %3A   Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator %0A Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for %0A the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research %0A indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 %0A emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan %0A and Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those %0A purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people %0A back to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you %0A  %0A  %0A can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position %0A they're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year %0A deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time %0A and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got %0A to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their %0A position.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this %0A kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to %0A work.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful. %0A We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good %0A about it. %0A  %0A      THE PRESS %3A   Thank you %0A  %0A                                  END       10 %3A 10 A.M.

If %0A    that is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything %0A    on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller.  Can anybody verify %0A    or refute this? %0A  %0A Yes, that's true.  TEMPEST is nothing magic, it's just listening to any %0A available electromagnetic emissions and using all the analysis techniques   %0A you know to separate out the interesting stuff.  %0A  %0A The nice thing about old CRTs is that they used to put out LOTS of %0A signal, so they're easy to detect, and if you do your sync carefully, %0A you can watch the output on the monitor in your deceptively-marked %0A Chevy Step-Van.  Some brands of electric typewriters were even worse. %0A In both cases, it's especially nice because it gets you the data the %0A user is looking at, rather than whatever stuff the paging algorithm is %0A paging out to disk, etc. %0A  %0A With newer, quieter equipment, there isn't as much signal, and it's harder to %0A isolate the fun parts.  TEMPEST-rated equipment has much lower signal levels. %0A But "Everything has vibrations", as Master Chuan said. %0A -- %0A #				Pray for peace;      Bill %0A # Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs %40 anchor.att.com AT&T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ %0A #	              No, I'm *from* New Jersey, I only *work* in cyberspace.... %0A # White House Commect Line 1-202-456-1111  fax 1-202-456-2461 %0A

I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on %0A Thursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable %0A time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I %0A attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.   %0A The document below is the result of that effort.  %0A  %0A Dorothy Denning %0A --------------- %0A  %0A                      THE CLIPPER CHIP %3A  A TECHNICAL SUMMARY %0A  %0A                                Dorothy Denning %0A  %0A                                 April 19, 1993 %0A  %0A  %0A INTRODUCTION %0A  %0A On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring %0A together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program %0A to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of %0A law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption %0A chip called the "Clipper Chip" together with a split-key approach to %0A escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from %0A both are needed to reconstruct a key. %0A  %0A  %0A CHIP STRUCTURE %0A  %0A The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption %0A algorithm called "Skipjack."  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared %0A with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16 %0A for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is %0A 16 Mbits a second. %0A  %0A Each chip includes the following components %3A  %0A  %0A    the Skipjack encryption algorithm %0A    F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips %0A    N, a 30-bit serial number %0A    U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip %0A  %0A  %0A ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP %0A  %0A To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T %0A telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and %0A we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure %0A conversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with %0A the device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can %0A be used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then %0A fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values %3A  %0A  %0A    E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and  %0A    E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.   %0A  %0A The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted %0A under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all %0A encrypted under the family key F. %0A  %0A  %0A CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW %0A  %0A All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer %0A information facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains %0A a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips %0A are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at %0A Mikotronx. %0A  %0A At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key %0A escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1 %0A into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values %0A serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers. %0A  %0A To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is %0A first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1. %0A S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a %0A 64-bit block R1 %3A  %0A  %0A         R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] . %0A  %0A Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and %0A N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed %3A    %0A  %0A         R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]  %0A         R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] . %0A  %0A R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The %0A first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The %0A rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 %0A are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow %0A agencies. %0A  %0A As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are %0A written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a %0A file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part %0A U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third %0A disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent %0A 2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips. %0A After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the %0A vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional %0A assurance that no information is left behind. %0A   %0A The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the %0A room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2, %0A and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to %0A the escrow agencies. %0A  %0A The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not %0A be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or %0A both may be independent from the government. %0A  %0A  %0A LAW ENFORCEMENT USE %0A  %0A When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they %0A will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get %0A access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in %0A place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with %0A Clipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the %0A family key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a %0A warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow %0A agents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce %0A the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K. %0A Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished %0A through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI. %0A  %0A  %0A ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.  All information is based on %0A information provided by NSA, NIST, and the FBI.  Permission to %0A distribute this document is granted. %0A  %0A  %0A      %0A

So the %0A  %3A    proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part  %0A  %3A    in three thousand to be cost-effective.  %0A  %0A Robin's calculation is interesting and important, even if it's off by %0A an order of magnitude (for example). %0A  %0A Even if hardware costs for the Clipper Chip phones were ZERO, the %0A protocol overhead in transmitting the escrow field would be much %0A higher than the 1 part in 3 thousand...it depends on the exact details %0A of the phone call length, protocol, etc. (shorter calls get a %0A proportionately greater hit). %0A  %0A However, I suspect most Americans will not find this line of reasoning %0A as persuasive as the analogies about escrowing keys to one's house %0A are. %0A  %0A -Tim May %0A  %0A  %0A --  %0A .......................................................................... %0A Timothy C.

It's a command to the spacecraft that tells %0A it "If you don't hear from Earth after 264 hours, assume something is wrong %0A with your (the spacecraft) attitude, and go into a preprogrammed search mode %0A in an attempt to reacquire the signal from Earth." %0A  %0A The spacecraft and Earth are not in constant communication with each other. %0A Earth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft, and if everything is fine, %0A there's no reason to send it any new information.  But from the spacecraft's %0A point of view, no information from Earth could mean either everything is %0A fine, or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition.  Just how long %0A should the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong and %0A begins to take corrective action?  That "how long" is the command loss timer. %0A During relatively inactive cruise phases, the command loss timer can be set %0A to rather long values.  In this case, Earth is telling Galileo "expect to %0A hear back from us sometime within the next 264 hours". %0A

Many different observations, including IRAS %0A > and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures %0A > can range from 40K to 150K. %0A  %0A Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The "large" %0A grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with %0A fair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the %0A thermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating %0A efficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long %0A wavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate %0A the energy they have absorbed. %0A  %0A Moreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100 %0A microns.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer %0A wavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In %0A the extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable %0A by any conceivable observation. %0A  %0A Worse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a %0A population of "small" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50 %0A atoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to %0A temperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool %0A quickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_ %0A the characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small %0A population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed %0A "average" temperature. %0A  %0A A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has %0A three components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal %0A dust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust %0A (Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At %0A the ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are %0A respectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly %0A doubled in the ecliptic plane. %0A  %0A To find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution %0A factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then %0A take the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from %0A Allen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent %0A to 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work %0A could do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a %0A dilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be %0A cooked if that were the case.  In any event, the energy density of %0A starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave %0A background, and I believe that to be correct.) %0A  %0A                          Dilution   Temp.

I was referring to the fact %0A that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For much %0A of the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the %0A industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired %0A and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point %0A where long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note that %0A the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927 %3A   Lindbergh, %0A Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.  "When it's time to railroad, %0A you railroad." %0A  %0A >>It didn't require gov't to fund these as long as something was known about %0A >>the potential for profit at the destination.

The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft), %0A Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in %0A 1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were %0A within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well %0A within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only %0A a gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever. %0A   Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by %0A taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane %0A that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions %0A asked. %0A  %0A --  %0A  Keith Mancus    <mancus %40 butch.jsc.nasa.gov>                           %7C %0A  N5WVR           <mancus %40 sweetpea.jsc.nasa.gov>                        %7C %0A  "Black powder and alcohol, when your states and cities fall,          %7C %0A   when your back's against the wall...." -Leslie Fish                  %7C %0A

Sounds like it %0A would have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairly %0A low orbit. %0A  %0A 	2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here? %0A What real impact are we talking about, really?  How many optical %0A astronomers are *really* going to be impacted? %0A  %0A 	3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of %0A 'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the %0A sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large %0A inflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)? %0A The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is %0A being used to help fund this thing. %0A  %0A 	4) If your answer to 3) above was "the astronomers", then feel %0A free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more %0A important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING %0A ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.

If it's a choice %0A between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is %0A only one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put %0A the dog first. %0A  %0A Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react %0A to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're %0A playing with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which %0A has hostile intent. %0A  %0A Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social %0A beasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are %0A two types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which %0A dominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the %0A latter class.  You are God %3A  you are easily angered and your anger is terrible. %0A But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may %0A even on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh %0A rapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit! %0A  %0A Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to %0A assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a %0A game, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one; %0A when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of %0A interception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so %0A that when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to %0A react to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a %0A motorcycle is capable of. %0A  %0A With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures %0A may be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important %0A -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the %0A road, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up %0A newspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will %0A hurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is %0A that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The %0A larger the dog, the greater your anger. %0A  %0A Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he %0A are not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he %0A is on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death. %0A  %0A Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory %0A where there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are %0A satisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped %0A punishment. %0A  %0A The interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great %0A deal to them.  The more effective you are at communicating body language, the %0A less you actually have to do.  After 7 years with my 93 pound beast, I've %0A learned a few tricks I think... %0A

Space Science %0A Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail %0A proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to %0A generate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at %0A the meeting. Here goes  %3A   %0A  %0A 			The Microlight Solar Sail %0A 			------------------------- %0A  %0A 1. Introduction %0A The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of %0A sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a %0A vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption. %0A  %0A However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most %0A people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per %0A square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized %0A fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type %0A spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte %0A idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date. %0A  %0A 2.Design %0A Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept %3A  a %0A tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely %0A be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control %0A methods are feasible %3A  for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a %0A panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn. %0A  %0A The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at %0A Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data %0A gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and %0A communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface %0A of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of %0A the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars. %0A  %0A 3.Missions %0A The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example %3A  %0A a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor %0A groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit %0A rate. %0A b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved %0A areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to %0A reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive %0A sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that %0A volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these %0A locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar %0A base, BTW] %0A c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet %0A nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft %0A causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged %0A tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an %0A ideal re-entry parachute %3A  load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat %0A is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 %0A deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating %0A container. %0A  %0A Contact %3A  Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447 %0A Oxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England %0A  %0A -------------------------------- %0A  %0A This guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or %0A seeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you more %0A information. %0A  %0A 	Andy %0A  %0A  %0A  %0A --  %0A                                   -----------------------------------  %0A Andy Jonathan J.
