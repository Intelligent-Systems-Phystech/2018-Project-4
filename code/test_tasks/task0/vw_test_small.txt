Well, for these guys, splitfires %0A > %0A >Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with %0A >somebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than %0A  %0A Splitfires work mainly by providing a more-or-less unshrouded spark to the %0A combustion chamber. If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this, %0A then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably %0A in lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC %0A pickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley %0A Sportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who've %0A tried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain %0A plugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers %0A are pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who %0A have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead, %0A I'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make %0A the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look %0A really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head) %0A --  %0A ============================================================================= %0A Neal Howard   '91 XLH-1200      DoD #686      CompuTrac, Inc (Richardson, TX) %0A 	      doh #0000001200   %7C355o33%7C      neal %40 cmptrc.lonestar.org %0A 	      Std disclaimer %3A  My opinions are mine, not CompuTrac's. %0A          "Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps %0A           we shall learn the truth." -- August Kekule' (1890) %0A ============================================================================= %0A

If there %0A are no new bids then the current bids stand (like that's gonna  happen.   %3A ) ). %0A After this, any updates will be by E-mail *ONLY*.  The entire auction  %0A will end as soon as the bids stop coming in.  So if you want to get in %0A on  this, be sure to bid now.  All bids must be made in *AT LEAST* %0A 25 cent increments.  Buyer will pay shipping.  (Unless you have any %0A particular fancy, it will be US mail 4th class special, with lots of %0A padding).   %0A All dragons are bagged.  The condition of them vary quite a bit,  %0A so I've come up with my own condition system.  Some dragons may be missing  %0A items like the inserts.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask. %0A * %0A Condition ratings - Usually this is just an evaluation of the cover, as %0A most of the material inside is in great shape. %0A Excellent - IE-"As you find them in the store" %0A Very Good -
